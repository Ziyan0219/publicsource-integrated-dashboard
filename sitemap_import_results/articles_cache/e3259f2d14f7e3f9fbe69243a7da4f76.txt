Posted in Election 2024 Election guide 2024: Who’s on the ballot in the Pittsburgh region? by Public Source October 8, 2024 November 5, 2024 Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X (Photo illustration by Natasha Vicens and Stephanie Mirah/PublicSource) Election Day is Nov. 5. Pennsylvanians’ ballots will not only feature the presidential and U.S. Senate contests, but also hundreds of races for the state House and Senate, which could determine the direction of state policy for years to come and receive comparatively little attention. Voters will also choose representatives for Pennsylvania’s 17 congressional districts and statewide offices for attorney general, auditor general and treasurer. Editor’s note: We created a nonpartisan voter guide to help Southwestern Pennsylvanians learn about who will be on their ballots and how to cast their votes. PublicSource does not endorse candidates. To broaden this public service and acknowledge our region’s interconnectedness, we expanded our coverage area to include all eight counties that make up the Pittsburgh Metropolitan Statistical Area.
