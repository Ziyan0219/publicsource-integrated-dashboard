Posted in DEVELOP PGH Bakery Square expansion wins first approval Long back-burnered by the City Planning Commission, Walnut Capital’s plan to add housing and retail to its development straddling Larimer and East Liberty now goes to Pittsburgh City Council. by Eric Jankiewicz September 3, 2024 September 3, 2024 Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X The Bakery Square logo in Pittsburgh's East End looks over a parking lot that Walnut Capital wants to redevelop. (Photo by Eric Jankiewicz/PublicSource) A Shadyside-developer’s effort to expand apartments and retail at the nexus of East Liberty and Larimer is one step closer to being realized after receiving approval from a city panel. Pittsburgh’s City Planning Commission approved Walnut Capital’s proposal to create retail and housing space after overcoming issues related to parking and sidewalk space. The commission unanimously approved a positive recommendation to City Council, which will now consider the matter. In July , the commission delayed making a decision on plans to expand retail and apartment housing capacity in Bakery Square by 14 acres along Penn Avenue. The panel wanted Walnut Capital to address concerns about parking and sidewalk space. During Tuesday’s hearing the developers agreed to several amendments including limiting parking to on-street and adjacent to streets. Then-City Councilor Ricky Burgess proposed an expansion bill in 2023. Walnut Capital’s representatives have been working on expansion plans with community members in Larimer and East Liberty. Tuesday’s approval is the result of several meetings in August between members of the City Planning Department, Zoning Board of Adjustment and Walnut Capital’s representatives, according to Senior Planning Manager Kate Rakus. “It was a little bit of work but we got there,” said commission chair LaShawn M. Burton-Faulk. Eric Jankiewicz is PublicSource’s economic development reporter, and can be reached at ericj@publicsource.org or on Twitter @ericjankiewicz .
