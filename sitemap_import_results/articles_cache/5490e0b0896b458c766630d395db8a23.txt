Posted in DEVELOP PGH Lower Hill developers get land for music venue — but not yet for parking garage The Pittsburgh Penguins’ development team asked local panels to sell two parcels of Hill land, but amid community concerns about unfulfilled promises a parking plan must wait. by Eric Jankiewicz and Laura Turbay July 25, 2024 September 24, 2025 Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X Hill Community Development Corporation President and CEO Marimba Milliones, center, speaks to reporters after the July 25, 2024 meeting of the Urban Redevelopment Authority board meeting. (Photo by Eric Jankiewicz/PublicSource) The redevelopment of the Lower Hill District may proceed — but piecemeal — after two panels approved the sale of part of the former Civic Arena site for the creation of a music venue, but decided that plans for a parking garage will be separated and deferred. The boards of the Urban Redevelopment Authority [URA] and the Sports & Exhibition Authority [SEA] voted Thursday to transfer nearly an acre of the Hill to the Penguins-related Pittsburgh Arena Real Estate Development LP [PAR] for construction of a Live Nation music venue. Transfer of an adjacent parcel will wait. The board also approved the use of $2 million in federal funds to restore and preserve the New Granada Theater on Centre Avenue, in the Middle Hill, which is owned by the nonprofit and registered community organization Hill Community Development Corporation. PAR triggered Thursday’s action through a formal request to the URA. The music venue and garage were formerly treated as one site. Plans for the area have been in the works since 2019 and first received approval from the City Planning Commission in January 2023. Those plans for the music venue along with a six-story parking garage, business incubator and public safety facility were then approved in May 2023 by the boards of the SEA and URA, which together control the former arena site. With the approval of the land transfer, developers expect construction to begin in September with the first show anticipated for early 2026. Shows at the venue will also include a $2 surcharge on every sale of a public ticket for the first 10 years of the venue’s operation. “We are ready to move forward with our plans for the new venue which will be a great addition to the neighborhood and bring even more shows to the region,” said Tom Loudermilk, Live Nation Pittsburgh’s president. “The venue will honor the Hill District’s history, and we are grateful to members of the community who have shared this history of the neighborhood with our team.” During Thursday’s board meeting Lower Hill residents expressed impatience and feeling “helpless,” after they said developers failed to keep promises made 15 years ago. Members of the community expressed regret and frustration with what they believe are failed promises from PAR, the SEA and the URA including: the funding and refurbishment of the Ammon Recreation Center, the First Source Center at which residents can find jobs, and a partnership with New Granada Theater to book shows. Under Thursday’s decision PAR will make a $900,000 donation to the city for the rehabilitation of the recreation center. Community members expressed dismay at the delayed construction of Curtain Call, an art installation meant to showcase the “essence of the Hill District’s history,” as one speaker at the URA board meeting put it. The Curtain Call art installation is to be completed by artist Walter Hood, and the development team was to fill the funding gap according to a 2019 term sheet. “We deserve to protect our history. We deserve that,” said 64-year-old Hill resident Renee Wilson at the URA meeting. But the plan has been marred by delays and site location modifications.

We’re taxpayers too,” said one resident during the in-person board meeting. Residents said unmet promises have opened old wounds as they reminded board members the Lower Hill was demolished in 1950 to make way for the Civic Arena. “ I stand before you today and ask that you get right with the Hill District by making sure that all of the conditions that were committed, in October of 2019, are part of any affirmative votes that you take today,” said Marimba Milliones, president and CEO of the Hill CDC. Developers said they have raised $2 million out of the $8 million needed for Curtain Call. New Granada Theater The URA board approved the use of $2 million from COVID-related federal funding to help the Hill CDC to restore the historic New Granada, a storied jazz venue. Those restoration plans call for the theater to be opened up to the public again with a community event space, performance space and restaurant. “Government unfortunately works very slow to determine how we could use this money,” said City Councilor Danielle Lavelle, who serves on the URA board. “I believe we’re doing right by the Hill District by investing $2 million into the New Granada Theater. We collectively recognize this is an asset for this region. We stand here very proud to make this investment.” Beechview property transfer A long-dormant property in Beechview will become future office space for a nonprofit focused on helping immigrants moving to the Pittsburgh area. The URA board approved the use of more than $2 million in COVID-related federal funds to help Casa San José construct a new office on Broadway Avenue. The URA obtained the property in 2008 after developer Bernardo Katz fled the country for Brazil and left the property in limbo.
