Posted in Community storytelling A shelter blaze kindled me to raise money for the pets of unhoused Pittsburghers Hearing news of a fire at Second Avenue Commons, and fortified by an unexpected honor, I resolved to do what I could to help pets who have been displaced along with their people. by First-person essay by Jeremy Carter December 13, 2024 December 14, 2024 Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X Jeremy Carter poses for a portrait with his dog Chase on Friday, Dec. 6, 2024, outside Second Avenue Commons in Uptown. (Photo by Anastasia Busby/PublicSource) In the midst of an ordinary workday, my phone buzzed incessantly with texts and emails bearing unsettling news: A homeless shelter in downtown Pittsburgh was ablaze. When I finally received an official email from the staff at ACTION-Housing, where I serve as the board secretary, my worst fears were confirmed. Second Avenue Commons was on fire . The shelter, operational for barely 18 months, had become a vital haven providing permanent housing and emergency shelter for nearly 200 individuals — and their pets. My heart ached at the thought of such a crucial resource facing devastation. In the immediate aftermath of the fire, I witnessed a rapid response as people were temporarily relocated to the David L. Lawrence Convention Center and later to Pittsburgh Mercy’s gym on the North Side. Animal rescue organizations swiftly stepped in, offering crates and pet supplies to cover short-term needs. Despite these efforts, for weeks the pets of Second Avenue Commons dominated my thoughts. I sought solace in my own pets (including my dog, cat and ferrets). Amid the tumult of my life, I have always found an unparalleled comfort in pets — one that humans alone could not provide. Why the plight of pets grabbed me At one point a well-meaning friend asked me, “The pets? What about the people?” It’s a valid question in such dire circumstances. However, as someone immersed in the housing sector in Pittsburgh, I knew that supportive programs were available to assist the displaced individuals. Pittsburgh Mercy, the shelter’s service provider, would ensure the basic needs of the people were met. Yet I was acutely aware that support for pets was often neglected in the emergency housing system. There are no federal grants catering to pets in homeless shelters. Most shelters, due to safety, health concerns or financial constraints, do not accommodate pets at all. This confluence of concerns — the scarcity of pet-friendly homeless shelters, the limited resources for pets accompanying their owners, and the heartbreaking reality that some people might choose to live outside rather than part with their pets — deeply troubled me. Having a pet during a crisis is crucial for one’s mental, social and emotional well-being. Jeremy Carter and his dog Chase pose for a photograph outside Second Avenue Commons, in Uptown, on Dec. 6. (Photo by Anastasia Busby/PublicSource) I felt compelled to act, though I wasn’t yet certain how. I moved from Michigan to Pennsylvania for AmeriCorps , only to find myself briefly homeless on the very day I left Michigan. My rental arrangement fell through just as I was awaiting my flight in Grand Rapids. Fortunately, AmeriCorps provided a strong support network, and I was able to stay with one of the directors until I secured my own rental.

Education Teachers learning to use — not fear — AI Inside our Newsroom Pittsburgh’s Public Source wins national award for impactful democracy-focused reporting This experience of arriving in Pittsburgh without a home to call my own became the catalyst for my career focused on aiding those without shelter. Following my time with AmeriCorps, I continued to assist others in securing housing through roles at organizations including Habitat for Humanity, Soldier On, Community Human Services, the Urban Redevelopment Authority and now UPMC Health Plan. I also have the honor of serving on the boards of several nonprofits, including ACTION-Housing, Oakland Planning and Development Corp. and the Oakland Development Fund. This commitment to housing initiatives would soon take on a new dimension when a crisis hit close to home and close to my heart. Answering the call to help For several weeks, I worried about the pets and people of Second Avenue Commons, but didn’t see a path to help. In early August, a seemingly random email caught my attention. To my surprise and profound honor, I learned that I had been named one of Pittsburgh Magazine and PUMP ’s 40 Under 40 honorees for 2024. I resolved to leverage this honor to support Second Avenue Commons, particularly its pets. I contacted the Allegheny County Department of Human Services and asked about any specific funding gaps related to Second Avenue Commons. I was somewhat surprised to learn that while the department offered a range of funding programs to address various needs, none were allocated for the support of pets and their owners within the shelter system. Jeremy Carter leveraged the prestige of a mention in Pittsburgh Magazine’s 40 under 40 list to raise funds for pets impacted by the Second Avenue fire earlier this year. (Photo by Anastasia Busby/PublicSource) Initially, I was told that my efforts were unnecessary, which led me to question whether a genuine need existed or if I was perhaps imagining one. I decided to go directly to the source. I reached out to the Second Avenue Commons board, whose president, Linda Metropulos, enthusiastically supported my idea of hosting a fundraiser for pet supplies. She connected me with Jody Figas, vice president of development at Pittsburgh Mercy, the shelter’s service provider, who confirmed the urgent need. Their sole grant for pet supplies had been exhausted, and the fire had destroyed their remaining stock. Jody loved the idea of using my new 40 under 40 platform to hold a fundraiser to help Second Avenue Commons and provide assistance for the pets. I ran with it — until a freak accident made running impossible. When a walk goes awry I began organizing a fundraiser, Play for Pets, with the goal of replenishing pet supplies at the shelter. The event would be held at Dave & Busters and include games, a dinner buffet, an open bar and a silent auction. My network rallied behind the cause. John G. Lovelace (former president of government programs for UPMC Health Plan), Adrienne Walnoha (chair of the Housing Opportunity Fund Advisory Board), and the Allegheny County Housing Authority generously sponsored the initiative. As I put together the Play for Pets website and started reaching out to friends, colleagues and family, I quickly learned that this cause resonated with many people. As ticket sales started to come in, I also started reaching out to local businesses for donations – either pet supplies for the shelter or donations for a silent auction to raise additional funds. And then, as if fate had a twisted sense of humor, I broke my foot. Just two weeks into my fundraising campaign, I fractured two bones and tore a ligament in my right foot on a simple, routine walk. Despite this unfortunate mishap occurring on Friday the 13th, I was resolute that it would not hinder my efforts. I worked on this effort every day for two months. I’d respond to emails early in the morning and make cold calls during my lunch break. I spent several weekends picking up donations across Allegheny County. (Mind you, I broke my driving foot, so big thanks to my husband for shuttling me all over the county several times!) As word spread, local businesses and national brands demonstrated remarkable compassion. Pennsylvania-based Armarkat donated cat beds, while Spectrum Brands contributed $1,300 worth of pet hygiene products and treats. Nylabone shipped 46 durable chew bones, and Up Country and Max & Neo provided 100 leashes, collars and harnesses. A regional pet supply distributor, Frontier Distributing, mobilized its network of local independent retailers to collect an astonishing $5,400 worth of supplies, which were delivered to Second Avenue Commons in November. This effort underscored the compassion of Pittsburgh’s people and businesses. Time and again, I heard variations of, “Most of us here have pets — we’d love to help!” The generosity was humbling. The purrfect ending to a ruff year On November 13, Play for Pets came to life. Guests enjoyed games, a silent auction and custom AI-generated songs celebrating Second Avenue Commons and Pittsburgh Mercy. Speaking at the event, I revealed my original goal of raising $7,500 had been vastly exceeded. Thanks to sponsorships, ticket sales and in-kind donations, the initiative raised over $17,500 in financial and material support for the shelter’s pets. These donations not only fill the empty shelves at the shelter, but they will provide much-needed supplies for the pets for at least the next year. The pet supplies collected include: 113 leashes, collars and harnesses 60 cat and dog toys 384 cans of cat food 10 bags of cat and dog food 290 cat treats 125 dog bones 76 bags of dog treats 12 cat beds 6 dog crates 30 mats 21 dog grooming tools 27 bags of pet bath wipes. The only thing that changes the world Margaret Mead’s assertion — “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world: indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has” — has deeply influenced my life. I first encountered the quote during my AmeriCorps service in Pittsburgh in 2010, and it has since become a guiding principle. Jeremy Carter and Chase (Photo by Anastasia Busby/PublicSource) Whether building coalitions for affordable housing or developing programs that integrate health and housing at UPMC Health Plan, this ethos has consistently driven my career and community work in Pittsburgh. Throughout my career, I’ve witnessed the resilience of those experiencing homelessness. Their struggles often reflect the lessons I’ve learned from pets: embracing imperfection, practicing persistence and the necessity of patience and compassion. In a world where these virtues sometimes seem rare, we must practice them not only with animals but also with one another. Service to others doesn’t always require grand gestures: It can begin with small acts of kindness. My experience with Play for Pets highlighted the transformative power of collective effort. Pittsburgh’s businesses and residents demonstrated that, together, we can address even the most unexpected needs. Reflecting on the honor of being part of the 40 Under 40 class, I realize that the true privilege lies in mobilizing compassion and generosity to effect change. Within each of us lies the power to create meaningful change. It simply takes the willingness to act.
