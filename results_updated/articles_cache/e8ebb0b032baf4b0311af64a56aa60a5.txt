More than a third of Allegheny County Council seats are on the ballot this year, along with five of nine Pittsburgh Public Schools board seats and four of nine Pittsburgh City Council seats. Voters registered as Democrats and Republicans went to the polls May 20 for primary elections to choose nominees for the Nov. 4 General Election. Independent and minor party candidates had until Aug. 1 to file to be on the November ballot. Allegheny County voters will also choose eight new judges for the Court of Common Pleas and decide whether seven sitting judges keep their jobs. Voters will also decide whether or not to retain two appeals court judges and three state Supreme Court justices, with the potential to shift the ideological leaning of the high court. Candidates may still be removed from the ballot if their petitions are successfully challenged in court. The lists below will be updated as new information becomes available.
