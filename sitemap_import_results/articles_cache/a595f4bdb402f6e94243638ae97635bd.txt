Posted in Local Government Pittsburgh officials look to generators to keep public safety station power on in storms The April 29 storm that knocked out power to much of Pittsburgh spurred a push for a more climate-resilient plan.

Pittsburgh Bureau Fire Chief Darryl Jones told City Council that the city completed an after-action review of the storm response. In addition to public communication, he identified adaptability as a strength. But outages at facilities, including sheltering centers, were concerning. Officials are now working to better deploy generators, and encouraging individual facilities to buy their own generators in preparation. Jones’ comments came at council’s first special meeting to review its response to the April 29 storm. Following the storm, Mayor Ed Gainey issued an executive order for a climate-resilient “All-Hazard Mitigation Plan.” Officials said work on that plan is ongoing.

Better identification skills could speed up power restoration. Currently, special coordination with Duquesne Light is required to confirm that a line is de-energized before work begins. Councilors Theresa Kail-Smith and Bob Charland expressed concern that emergency services did not update council members adequately during the storm. “I often struggle in knowing who my point of contact is in an emergency situation,” Charland said. “I just want to know so I know what I’m saying is correct.” Jones identified a course for public and elected officials to understand the incident command system. Allegheny County Hazard Mitigation Plans are updated every five years and signed off by local municipalities, including Pittsburgh. The county began updating the plan last year and it is due in March of 2026. It will be completed internally by the end of September before it is sent to PMA and FEMA for review. Gainey’s May executive order calls for a more localized “All-Hazard” Mitigation plan, which will take a long-term approach to disaster management, including flood and landslide prevention.

Officials are beginning to consider how they will approach planning for high winds, but the city is unlikely to cut down healthy trees in preparation according to Flore Marion, the city’s assistant director of sustainability and resilience. At the May resilience forum, it was clear that downed trees on power lines were the main culprit for power outages across the city. The All-Hazard Mitigation Plan will balance emergency resilience with year-round livability. “Pittsburgh is an extremely green city,” said Michael Kelley, the city’s utility coordination arborist, at the May meeting. “We have over 3 million trees — and these trees, they serve as the lungs and kidneys of our city.” The Allegheny River floods the North Shore riverwalk outside of PNC Park in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, April 3, 2024.

Planning is attending EMS meetings and hiring a staff member to work with the medics. Council will hold a separate meeting to review the Duquesne Light’s storm response on September 18.
