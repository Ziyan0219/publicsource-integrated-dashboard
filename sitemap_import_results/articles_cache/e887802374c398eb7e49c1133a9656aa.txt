Spring 2017 PublicSource editorial internship PublicSource is a nonprofit online journalism organization in Pittsburgh. It is our mission to listen, to investigate, to reveal the untold stories in the Pittsburgh region. We write stories with powerful narratives and characters to explain complex issues in the areas of criminal justice, the environment, money & politics, health and education. Check us out at PublicSource.org. If you’re interested in what we do, here’s what we’re looking for in an editorial intern: We want someone who goes through life with an eye for untold stories and can figure out how to tell those stories through interviews and research as well as technically sound and compelling writing. We expect interns to both assist and work on long-term projects as well as shorter enterprise stories that could only take a day or two to complete. This person will be hungry to learn more about data journalism and visualization and all multimedia. If you have skills in it already, even better. You should also be able to share your story on social media and have ideas for how all of our stories could get more exposure. (Note: We will check your social media accounts.) And accuracy will be king to the right intern. You’ll do your own fact checks and help staffers. PublicSource, a nonprofit newsroom, will pay each intern a $700 stipend for the semester. If you have a professor who will give you credit, we’re happy to fill out the forms. We would prefer an intern to join us for at least 15 hours a week for the entirety of the semester. Our offices are at 746 E. Warrington Ave. in the Allentown neighborhood, right on the bus line. Please send a cover letter, resume and any appropriate work examples by or before Dec. 1 to Halle Stockton at halle@publicsource.org.
