(Photo by Jay Manning/PublicSource) Allegheny County offers multiple ways to cast a vote in advance of the Nov. 5 presidential election. They all involve mail-in ballots, which voters can request until Oct. 29. Voters who receive a mail-in ballot can return it through the mail or at one of 10 ballot return sites throughout the county, which will be staffed by county employees. Voters can also request, mark and return a ballot in one visit at any of five satellite election offices. Jump to: How to get a mail in ballot , important deadlines , ballot drop-off sites , “over the counter” voting sites , how to vote in person How to get a mail-in ballot To have a ballot sent to your home, request one through the Pennsylvania website . Allegheny County has already mailed ballots out to most of those who have so far requested them and will mail ballots to new requesters on a rolling basis. Important deadlines The last day to request a mail-in ballot or vote at a satellite election office is Oct. 29. Those who receive a mail-in ballot have until 8 p.m. on Election Day, Nov. 5, to return it to the county. Ballots received after that time will not count — no matter when they are postmarked. Any voter who has not yet returned a ballot in the final days before Nov. 5 is urged to return it in person instead of through the mail. The deadline to register to vote is Oct. 21. Ballot drop-off sites Ballot drop-off sites are staffed and monitored by county elections employees, and ballots are securely transported to the county’s storage facility at the end of each day. They are stored along with ballots returned by mail, and will not be opened or counted until Election Day. Each voter can only return their own ballot. Drop-off sites will be open from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Oct. 29-Nov. 1, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Nov. 2-3 and 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Nov. 4. The 10 ballot drop-off sites will be at: County Office Building lobby, 542 Forbes Ave., Pittsburgh 15219 Allegheny Emergency Services Building, 150 Hookstown Grade Road, Coraopolis, 15108 Boyce Park Four Seasons Lodge, 901 Centerview Drive, Plum 15239 Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh — Squirrel Hill, 5801 Forbes Ave., 15217 North Park Ice Rink, 1200 Pearce Mill Road, Wexford 15090 South Park Ice Rink, 30 Corrigan Drive, Bethel Park 15102 Dormont Pool, 1801 Dormont Ave., Pittsburgh 15216 CCAC Homewood, 701 N.

To do this, voters must bring the ballot and pre-addressed return envelope to the polling place and sign a declaration that they have not voted by mail. If you lost your mail-in ballot or have reason to believe it did not make it back to the elections office, you can ask to cast a provisional ballot at your polling place. After Election Day, the county will verify that your mail-in ballot was not counted, and then count your provisional ballot. Check the status of your mail-in ballot here .
