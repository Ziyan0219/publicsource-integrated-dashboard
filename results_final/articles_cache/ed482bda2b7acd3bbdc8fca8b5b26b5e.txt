Posted in Pittsburgh at Work Trump and Musk oppose remote work, but it has fans in Pittsburgh PublicSource asked its audience to share the ways work has changed since the pandemic arrived five years ago. Respondents focused on one innovation — remote work — and sang its praises. by Rich Lord February 28, 2025 March 1, 2025 Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X (Illustration by Natasha Vicens/PublicSource) PublicSource, with Technical.ly, is exploring the landscape of work in Pittsburgh — famed for its industriousness and intense union-management conflict and collaboration — as it is pressure-tested by changes in governmental policy, technology and economics. Everything changed five years ago next month. And while some people in power want to largely terminate the remote and hybrid work that emerged in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a sample of Pittsburgh professionals told PublicSource that they hope it’s here to stay. Last week, as we launched the Pittsburgh at Work series, we asked audience members to tell us how their employment has evolved since 2020. Our callout came as President Donald Trump and his ally billionaire Elon Musk doubled down on bids to force federal workers to uniformly return to the office. Respondents — who were invited, but not required to provide basic identifying information — said they treasure the flexibility of online working arrangements.

Then from March 2020 through December 2024 I was almost entirely remote, with an in-office meeting monthly-ish. I recently started a new job for another university. Now I am fully remote and will travel to another state a couple of times a year for team meetings. My actual job is fairly similar, other than a standard amount of job progression in responsibility and payment for the elapsed years; my overall career trajectory hasn’t changed. My random workday interruptions now come from cats instead of coworkers, but are otherwise similar!” Kyle, 42, Lawrenceville General counsel for a national affordable housing provider “My job title and field are the same, but I went from working for a local company in a Downtown office to a national company from a home office/co-working space.” Name not provided, 40 , Downtown Tech contractor at a major local corporation “My circumstances are vastly different as my expectations have changed. I have over 15 years working in technology roles; I do not and will not accept working in an office five days a week just to sit on Teams calls with remote team members. My expectations have shifted toward employers understanding that I have a life and that my life doesn’t revolve around the workplace. Many managers, to their credit, seem to understand, agree and practice this work-life paradigm themselves.” Alicia, 36 , Bellevue Art director for an advertising agency HEALTH Death of an ‘elder orphan’ warns that aging alone may become more dangerous Trump Impacts Pittsburgh leaders try to coordinate response to Trump budget cuts, seeing ‘long haul’ challenges Inside our Newsroom PublicSource stories on overdoses, jail program win Vann awards ENVIRONMENT Fearing radioactive waste, Grove City community fights to stop landfill reopening ECONOMY & HOUSING Gainey has 7 months and 7 major development priorities.
