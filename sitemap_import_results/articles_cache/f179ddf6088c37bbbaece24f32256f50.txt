Posted in HEALTH Allegheny County could clean up properties — and make owners pay The county Board of Health voted in support of legislation that would allow county crews to remediate outdoor hazards, then lien the properties. The measure now goes to County Council for a vote. by Venuri Siriwardane July 16, 2025 July 17, 2025 Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X Lyssa Eberhardt and Asher Khersonsky, of Allegheny CleanWays, clear debris from condemned houses in McKeesport on June 27.

The enforcement tool is an amendment to Article VI , the county’s housing code, which was updated last year for the first time in a quarter-century. It empowers the county Health Department to hire a contractor to clean up tire piles, unmaintained swimming pools, hoarding around the exterior of a home and other health hazards. Such a move would be an escalation if attempts by the county to order the property owner to address the hazard are ignored, and fines the county imposes go unpaid. The county can put a lien on the property to ensure the cost of the clean-up can be covered via seizure and sale of the home, said County Councilor Michelle Naccarati-Chapkis, who chairs the county’s new Housing and Community Environment Advisory Committee . She’s also the executive director of Women for a Healthy Environment , a nonprofit working to promote healthy housing in the county. A tenant advocate described the update as “a good start” toward a more proactive approach to enforcing the housing code. Advocates have long criticized the Health Department for relying on a complaint-driven system that pits vulnerable tenants against landlords. “It’s a pretty effective remedy and it should certainly be in the toolbox,” said Kevin Quisenberry, the litigation director of Community Justice Project , which provides legal aid to tenants. The amendment gives the department “leverage” to “make sure the work gets done,” he added. The advisory committee worked with department staffers to draft the amendment. The group is a mechanism for public oversight of housing policy that tenant advocates had pushed for since former County Executive Rich Fitzgerald was in office. The committee was created last year under new County Executive Sara Innamorato’s leadership. Its members include elected officials, housing advocates, a real estate agent, a public health professor, a legal aid lawyer who represents tenants and other experts. “They’ve been really receptive to feedback,” said Naccarati-Chapkis, describing the collaborative process between the committee and the department. “We’re off to a great start and it’s working well.” The committee voted unanimously on July 8 to send the amendment to the Board of Health for approval — their first major action since they began meeting in March. The amendment will be sent to County Council for final approval. Lyssa Eberhardt, of Allegheny CleanWays, clears debris from condemned houses in McKeesport on June 27.

Tire piles that collect rainwater create breeding grounds for mosquitoes and hoarding near homes attracts rats, among other disease vectors, she said. “We’re seeing more and more abandoned properties, more and more people who maybe can’t or aren’t taking care of their property and some confusion between who’s supposed to take care of the property — the landlord or the tenant,” she added.

If action isn’t taken after months of legal notices, “we’re forced to step in for the greater good,” he told Larkins-Pettigrew. A spokesperson for a group that represents the interests of landlords and property owners pointed out the county and its municipalities have “existing enforcement clean-up mechanisms in place.” This new proposal brings in “additional private contractors to provide these services,” wrote John Petrack, executive vice president of the Realtors Association of Metropolitan Pittsburgh . “As many of the properties in question are owned by modest consumers, we would like to see as many warnings and chances for remediation as possible before placing potentially higher costs upon the consumer,” he added, noting the group believes local government plays “a vital role in addressing major health and safety violations in our communities.” Quisenberry urged the advisory committee to build on this “good enforcement tool” by steering the Health Department toward a more proactive rental inspection system. He suggested a rental licensing program that requires units to be inspected regularly. “It would almost totally remove this whole paradigm of having to file a complaint and stick your neck out, make yourself the enemy of your landlord and risk retaliation or eviction because you’ve done it,” he said. A 2021 investigation by Pittsburgh’s Public Source and WESA found that the Health Department received an average of 1,900 complaints of unhealthy housing annually and conducted 3,000 inspections, but levied just a few dozen fines per year and collected only a fraction of those.
