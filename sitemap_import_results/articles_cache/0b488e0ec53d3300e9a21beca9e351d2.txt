Posted in Community storytelling Photo essay: Canonsburg’s outsized Fourth of July parade sees tens of thousands celebrate the nation’s history, spirit On a holiday that celebrates America, amid a polarizing political season, a town that has been part of the national narrative in many ways comes together to get its red, white and blue on. by Stephanie Strasburg July 4, 2024 September 10, 2024 Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X The New Horizons Majorettes from Clairton prepare to dance their way through the Canonsburg 4th of July Parade, Thursday, July 4, 2024. The girls were part of 125 units of people marching in the hours long parade. (Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/PublicSource) Two days before the first star spangled floats and marching bands of the Canonsburg 4th of July Parade plodded up the slopes of Pike Street, anticipatory rows of folding chairs laid claim to the street curbs. Come Thursday morning, tens of thousands of people packed the street’s parade route as the ringing of church bells, a rendition of the national anthem and the rumble of antique cars signaled the start of the procession through the Washington County town’s business district. Pittsburgh stories through photos The annual Canonsburg parade started in 1963, when America was more than a bit different. John F. Kennedy was president amid the unrest of the Vietnam War and the civil rights movement, the use of ZIP codes had just been introduced, and there was only one “Wal-Mart Discount City” in the country. At that same time, Perry Como , born one of 13 children to an Italian millworker in Canonsburg, was hosting his successful NBC variety show, “Perry Como’s Kraft Music Hall.” Since then, the town has made its own news in relation to industry booms and busts (and booms again). It has drawn other famous folk, including Pittsburgh’s Wiz Khalifa, who bought a home there in 2012. But it’s the local lore of leaders of the Whiskey Rebellion tearing open stolen federal mail sacks in the back room of the town’s Blackhorse Tavern that seems to tether the town to both the foundations and evolution of American history. Fast forward to 2024, in an election year that calls us to continually question what it means to be American. The shoulder-to-shoulder scene at the Canonsburg 4th of July Parade offers a public forum to explore that meaning, in all its complicated packaging. PublicSource photojournalist Stephanie Strasburg headed to the parade to document the feeling at one of Pennsylvania’s largest Independence Day celebrations.

We saw people squeezed where we don’t normally see people,” said Carmina V. Vitullo, the chairperson of the Canonsburg 4th of July committee.
