Posted in Inside our Newsroom How we’re covering the 2024 election and its far-reaching implications We’re committed to focusing on the facts, countering (without amplifying) disinformation and assessing its impact on our lives. by Charlie Wolfson June 24, 2024 June 24, 2024 Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X Insurrectionists scale the walls of the Capitol Building from the West Front on January 6, 2021. (Quinn Glabicki for PublicSource) If the 2020 election taught us anything, it’s that misinformation can travel fast on the internet, and news organizations need to be prepared to keep up. We at PublicSource are not waiting until autumn to get started. As the local government reporter, I have already begun investigating what is happening in our region around election administration and what’s coming next for some of the most prominent actors of 2020. In March, we uncovered a GOP faction’s scheme to purge tens of thousands of names from Allegheny County’s voter rolls. We, along with our news partners at WESA, were the only outlets in the region to publicize the plan, and we pressed the county’s Elections Division for details on what it means for the voters involved. In May, we revisited one of the most virulent pieces of disinformation from 2020 — the false claim by former President Trump that mail-in ballots were the target of fraud in that election. We found that local Republican leaders want their supporters to vote by mail this year to boost their chances of success, but many of the party’s members are still skeptical of the voting method, apparently still convinced by the former president’s lies. Reporting on disinformation is an evolving science. We met with Pitt’s Disinformation Lab in March to discuss the best approaches, including how to decide when to publicly expose a lie and when doing so would give false theories more oxygen and do more harm than good. These are hard choices, but the discussion reinforced for me how important our role is, this year more than usual. Election outcomes will reverberate in every corner of our society. So it’s not just me who will be covering this hotly contested election season that will decide control of the presidency, Congress, the state General Assembly and other influential offices. Every journalist at PublicSource is evaluating the potential implications of the 2024 general election in their coverage areas — from health to environment and education to economic development.
