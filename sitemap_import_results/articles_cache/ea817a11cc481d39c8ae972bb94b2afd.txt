PRT’s board met June 27 and approved a 2025-2026 budget based on “conservative” revenue projections, while Pennsylvania lawmakers continue to wrangle over a state budget that could address county transit funding needs. Earlier this year, PRT announced budgetary shortfalls over $100 million as pandemic relief money dries up and ridership remains well below pre-2020 averages. That would lead to the elimination of 40 bus routes, the termination of the Silver T line and reduced service to remaining routes, officials warned. The agency would also lay off staff and increase ride fares by 25 cents.

PRT requested $117 million from the state government in a bid to maintain existing services. Gov. Josh Shapiro proposed an additional $40 million in his budget, which has cleared the Democratic-controlled House but faces challenges in the Republican Senate. “We remain hopeful that the voices of the thousands of riders and employees and vendors and business owners…. results in a favorable outcome,” Kelleman said.
