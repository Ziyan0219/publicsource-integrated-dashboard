Posted in Education Winnie’s Wagon delivers kids’ science experiments to shelters and sidewalks The number of students without permanent housing is rising in Allegheny County. A mobile classroom motors around the region to bridge the learning gaps caused by housing insecurity. by Lajja Mistry August 18, 2025 Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X Siblings Pedro, left, 10, Angelee, back left, 13, and Reinalee, front, 8, meet with Madeline Phillips, right, interim education support coordinator with HCEF, and volunteer Shirley Gibson, inside Winnie’s Wagon, Thursday, Aug. 7, 2025, in West Mifflin.

A bright blue van pulled up to the curb, its bold, white lettering proclaiming, “Winnie’s Wagon.” The students ran to the van, shouting excitedly, “We’re making a volcano!” Renna L.

Brown, HCEF’s STEAM mobile learning coordinator, passed out cups filled with sand to each student and guided them through a fun science experiment. Their goal? To discover which type of vinegar would cause a bigger reaction by building a mini volcano in a cup. She asked the students to sprinkle baking soda on top of the sand and then pour a glass of white vinegar on top. Instantly, a frothy eruption bubbled over the edges. “Woah, that’s crazy!” said ten-year-old Khloe. “How does it feel like? How is the cup from the outside?” Brown asked, prompting the students to touch and explore the reaction. “It’s hot!” said six-year-old Hailey. “It feels like a soft pear,” she added, digging her fingers into the foamy mixture. “When you touch it, it’s warm,” said Brown. “That’s how you know it’s a chemical reaction.” Hailey, 6, feels the baking soda and sand mixture used for her science experiment led by HCEF’s Winnie’s Wagon on Aug. 7.

(Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/Pittsburgh’s Public Source) Nykwest, senior director of programs at HCEF, said the program is targeted toward students experiencing housing instability, particularly those who live outside of shelters. The mobile learning program began in early 2021, when the HCEF staff started delivering supplies to students who lacked transportation to pick them up from schools. From there, it evolved to offering tutoring services to students at their homes. A recent report by the state Department of Education’s Education for Children and Youth Experiencing Homelessness revealed a 17% increase in the number of students experiencing homelessness in Allegheny County from the previous year. More than half of the county’s unhoused students were chronically absent from school, resulting in learning loss because of missed classes. Of the total students experiencing homelessness, 70% were doubled up in shared housing situations and only 18% were living in shelters or transitional housing. The mobile learning program works to bridge the learning gaps that affect students transitioning between temporary living situations.

The mobile classroom hosts art supplies, games, books, snacks and learning devices to serve children experiencing housing insecurity.

Winnie’s Wagon travels across the Pittsburgh region, offering personalized tutoring services by meeting students where they are. It also stops at shelters to deliver STEM and STEAM workshops. So far this year, the mobile learning program has tutored 130 students.

(Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/Pittsburgh’s Public Source) After finishing up at the Sojourner building in Squirrel Hill, Nykwest drove Winnie’s Wagon to West Mifflin to meet Ada Quinones, whose three children had a weekly mobile learning tutoring session. As the Wagon pulled into the parking lot by the house, tutor Madeline Phillips and volunteer Shirley Gibson walked up with the students — Pedro, Reinalee and Angelee. It was the children’s first tutoring session inside Winnie’s Wagon. Inside, the van had been transformed into a cozy, vibrant classroom. A small table and stools formed a workspace, with a cushioned bench running along the side. Another shelved wall is stacked with a colorful library of books, games and toys. The Wagon also keeps snacks and stationery supplies and tech tools such as Wi-Fi, a 3D printer and tablets for the students to use. Reinalee, 8, reaches for art supplies as she explores the educational and creative offerings in HCEF’s mobile classroom, Winnie’s Wagon, on Aug. 7 in West Mifflin. Reinalee and her siblings started receiving tutoring support from HCEF while living in a shelter, and continue trips on the wagon after settling into their current home. (Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/Pittsburgh’s Public Source) Quinones has used HCEF services since 2021, when she was living in a shelter. The organization continued supporting the family after she moved into her current house in West Mifflin by providing math, tutoring and reading support to her kids. Without that, keeping her kids on track with school would have been challenging, Quinones said. “They make them read. Some of them don’t like to read, so they have to read. … which is good, because in school, they’re going to do more than that.” Angelee, 13,  practices counting in twos with encouragement and guidance from volunteer Shirley Gibson, during a tutoring session inside Winnie’s Wagon, on Aug. 7 in West Mifflin. (Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/Pittsburgh’s Public Source) Phillips kicked off the class with a creative writing prompt: “A strange spaceship has crashed in your backyard. What would you do?” Eight-year-old Reinalee wrote about aliens emerging from the spaceship and attacking her family. She loves reading and picked out a book about elephants while snacking on applesauce. Her brother, Pedro, 10, wasn’t interested in writing that day. Instead, he sat cross-legged on the floor playing a game of Connect 4. Thirteen-year-old Angelee curled up on the cushioned bench with Gibson, wrapped in a blue blanket. Her story involved fixing the spaceship and then breaking it again. She is passionate about drawing cats, humans and roses and is currently learning Spanish. She wants to be a teacher when she grows up. Lajja Mistry is the K-12 education reporter at Pittsburgh’s Public Source. She can be reached at lajja@publicsource.org .
