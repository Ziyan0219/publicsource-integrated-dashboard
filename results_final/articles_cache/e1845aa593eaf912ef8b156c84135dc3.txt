Posted in ECONOMY & HOUSING Pittsburgh’s planners look to festivals, ‘mini grants’ to draw massive input for comprehensive plan An emerging plan would aim to weave many neighborhood plans and fill gaps for a first-ever comprehensive plan for Pittsburgh’s future.

To get that input, they intend to offer grants to groups, and show up where people congregate. City officials and a steering committee made up of civic and community leaders welcomed guests from all over Pittsburgh to an event Thursday evening launching the Pittsburgh 2050 Comprehensive Plan . Though many Pittsburgh neighborhoods have created their own plans, this comprehensive citywide plan would be the first of its kind. City Planning Director Jamil Bey said the goal is to connect those neighborhood plans into a more comprehensive plan with citywide consensus. “Neighborhoods don’t exist in isolation,” Bey said. “So this connects those plans. We are committed to honoring and respecting those plans and tying them into this comprehensive plan.” Bey said the administration wants every resident in the city to have the chance to weigh in, adding that city leaders “need to hear from everybody.” We are local reporters who tell local stories.

In 2023, Pittsburgh City Council approved a $2,645,000 contract with Common Cause Consultants to support the planning process. In early 2024, council approved another pact, of $3,255,000, with HR&A Advisors & Urban American City to assist in the process. According to Assistant Director of Strategic Planning Sharonda Whatley, the $1,000 mini grants will be available to community organizations and residents who “have traditionally been left out of the typical comp plan process.” Whatley said city officials are also aware of “at least 45 festivals happening across the city over the summer” that they hope to participate in.

Sherrill said an application portal will emerge “later on in the spring” through which people can apply for the mini grants. During a presentation Thursday, Bey and Whatley said the planning process will be “iterative, and driven by community.” The current planning phase focuses on “developing a Just Pittsburgh framework and increasing awareness of the plan across Pittsburgh,” according to the presentation by Bey and Whatley. The city will continue collecting community feedback through meetings, events and online surveys through September 2025, Bey and Whatley said, and will develop planning scenarios through “a collaborative process with community members” between August 2025 and April 2026.

During a Jan. 28 City Planning Commission hearing on proposed changes to zoning rules, city officials showed a slide indicating that they’d held 18 community meetings on the topic since last summer. Numerous speakers, though, said they had not been aware of those meetings, and had relatively recently become aware of the proposals. The perception of a lack of public input can breed mistrust. Marciana Rossi of Sheraden told the planning commission last Tuesday that her neighborhood has changed significantly over the years without resident’s participation. “It sounds like another land grab to me because I’ll be damned if anybody in my neighborhood knows about this meeting. All of these things are secret. Don’t be so secretive.” Bella Markovitz is an editorial intern at PublicSource and can be reached at bella@publicsource.org.
