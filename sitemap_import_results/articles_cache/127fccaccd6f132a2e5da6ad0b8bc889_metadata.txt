I just wanted to take a straightforward look to see how the landscape has been changed by the drilling boom.”One family’s journey with Marcellus ShalePhotos by Scott GoldsmithArticle by Sharon WalshScott Goldsmith was a newcomer to the topic of Marcellus Shale drilling when he began taking photos of the Hallowich family of Western Pennsylvania in 2010.The Hallowiches became well known as the Washington County family that moved into what they thought was their dream home and then had health problems that they believed were caused by drilling on their property.Marcellus Shale’s ‘accidental activists’Photos by Lynn JohnsonArticle by Sharon WalshLynn Johnson is pale.
