In every Pennsylvania county, voters will have the opportunity to weigh in on statewide races for president, U.S. Senate, attorney general, auditor general and treasurer. Allegheny County will also cast votes for two congressional seats, three state Senate seats and 21 state House seats. The county, and its politically diverse suburbs in particular, could go a long way toward deciding which party controls Congress and both chambers of the state House. The 17th Congressional district, encompassing western, northern and eastern suburbs as well as Beaver County, was decided by just 5 percentage points in 2022 and is one of a few dozen districts nationwide that both parties are heavily invested in ahead of what is expected to be a closely decided race for control of the House of Representatives. The state House and Senate are each currently divided by a small handful of seats, and an equal number of swingy suburban seats in Allegheny County could decide who calls the shots in Harrisburg.
