Posted in Forecast: Uncertain Economic pressures are building across the region. How will Pittsburgh’s public and private leaders respond? From rising construction costs to shrinking tax revenue and the end of federal relief, Pittsburgh’s future may hinge on how developers, business leaders and governments respond to mounting strain. by Eric Jankiewicz July 8, 2025 September 24, 2025 Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X (Photo illustration by Natasha Khan Vicens/PublicSource) As national and global turbulence filters down — from presidential politics to trade wars and AI disruptions — Pittsburgh faces an economic inflection point. Big developers. Small businesses. Job hunters. Pittsburgh navigates a time of turmoil. The region has strong bones: research institutions, energy resources and a foundation of innovation. But whether it can weather a downturn may depend on how local leaders respond to stubborn population loss, Downtown decline and the fast-approaching end of federal pandemic-era funding. Urban policy expert Bruce Katz put it plainly: “You’ve got to embrace how volatile this period is. Everyone thinks this is volatile because of [President Donald] Trump but it’s more than him.” The shifting conditions are visible across the region’s landscape: Downtown leasing is down more than 60% from pre-pandemic levels, straining property tax revenue. Developers are contending with rising costs driven by tariffs, inflation and labor uncertainty. New data centers powered by natural gas raise concerns about grid capacity and automation’s impact on jobs. Meanwhile, the regional workforce faces pressure to adapt to AI and emerging technologies. “Pittsburgh has a tremendous opportunity to own its future,” said Katz, director of the Nowak Metro Finance Lab at Drexel University, “but it has to understand where the opportunities are and how to unlock it.” He sees Pittsburgh as well-positioned thanks to assets like the robotics hub in Hazelwood Green, a growing tech cluster in Bakery Square and Carnegie Mellon’s AI and defense research. “Pittsburgh is unusual because it does have the starting position along multiple fronts.” From affordable housing to economic development and workforce readiness, PublicSource spoke with developers, business leaders and government officials to understand how they’re navigating the uncertainty — and what’s at stake if the region can’t find its footing.

He emphasized the need for more cooperation among local leaders. “Now more than ever, we need local government to be proactive in creating opportunities to grow our city, grow housing — whatever your agenda,” Reidbord said. “The secret sauce is partnerships between state and local,” he added.

TREK works on both market-rate and affordable housing projects. “What would be a normal amount of inflation would be 2-3%, but what we’re seeing is 8% of an increase,” Gatti said. Reidbord and other developers said variables like the changing cost of construction goods cast uncertainty over future projects.

Josh Shapiro is attempting to help with these challenges but “he has a divided legislature so it’s difficult.” People look at mock ups of new Downtown projects as Gov. Josh Shapiro and Lt. Gov. Austin Davis hold a press conference announcing nearly $600 million for Downtown development, Oct. 25, in Downtown. (Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/PublicSource) As a result of this uncertainty, Gatti said Trek projects for 2026 have either slowed or come to a halt. “The affordable projects are generally moving forward but they’re relying on more support from lenders and investors,” Gatti said. “Our market-rate projects are all just sitting, not advancing until we see how things are going to end up.” Tariffs making affordable housing even harder Nationally, signs point to an economic slowdown, and developers say tariffs are already affecting Allegheny County’s housing construction market — a trend they expect to worsen next year. “Everything is going to go up exponentially,” said Jason Tigano, CEO of LEVEL Equity Building. The nonprofit rehabilitates homes to sell for $80,000 to $120,000 to low-income households. But with a system largely geared toward rentals and rising material costs, his efforts to expand affordable homeownership in places like McKees Rocks are becoming harder to sustain.

(Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/PublicSource) “My costs are going to go up 20% in materials from tariffs,” Tigano said. “We get most of our lumber from Canada.” Labor concerns add another layer: “I have crews that have gone dark because of the ICE activity. They are legal, but they’re scared.” An April report from the International Monetary Fund warned that escalating trade conflicts and “high levels of policy uncertainty” could slow both short- and long-term growth. With economies highly interconnected, disruptions abroad are more likely to affect regions like Pittsburgh. “Scaling back international cooperation could jeopardize progress toward a more resilient global economy,” the report stated. The report also noted that the global economy is still recovering from recent shocks and remains vulnerable. Meanwhile, trade tensions appear to be rising, with a federal court recently restoring former President Trump’s authority to impose tariffs under a national emergency — a move that could further drive up costs and delay development.

But so far, she said, the region’s assets haven’t translated into broad-based growth. “There’s lots of great things happening and an immense asset base. Unfortunately none of that has yielded growth from a job, population and economic perspective,” said Pashman, CEO of the Allegheny Conference on Community Development. “So when you come from a place of scarcity with [the] tax base, it creates limiting factors,” she said. “We’re focused on how do we turn the tide so that we have growth that positions us for investment.” Pashman noted investments like a planned data center in Homer City, and the countercurrents of uncertainty created by federal policy shifts and uneven impact of new business. read more on homer city’s planned data center Economy & Housing A $10 billion power plant 50 miles east of Pittsburgh would transform a former coal town — but into what? Without coal jobs, Homer City and area schools have struggled. Burning gas to power AI could fuel a boom, but some see greener paths forward. “We’re somewhat in a positive light on the business investment side but it doesn’t mean that these other things aren’t true — that communities are in trouble, business is in flux,” she said. “Maybe we can emerge with opportunity.” Population growth has stagnated, she said, in part because of a shortage of quality job opportunities. “We want to see more job growth and that will in turn bring population growth,” she said. “We need good companies, the right jobs, career pathway types of jobs that create stable income for families.” The Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission is receiving a federal grant of $24.8 million to help with workforce development. Pashman warned that due to demand from residents and emerging technologies like AI that Southwestern Pennsylvania is projected to face a 40-gigawatt shortfall within the next five years.

The controlled demolition came more than a year after the power plant shuttered , and its implosion marked the end of coal-burned power in Allegheny County. (Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/PublicSource) A funding hangover and changing tax revenue For the last five years, Pittsburgh and the rest of the country have enjoyed an unprecedented level of federal funding through the COVID-era American Rescue Plan Act [ARPA]. The economic stimulus is now coming to an end, and the city and region will have to come up with ways to mitigate the funding loss and ease the hangover pains, according to City Controller Rachael Heisler. The city’s $335 million in ARPA funding has nearly run out, dropping from $46.5 million in 2024 to about $238,000 in the 2025 budget. Funding from ARPA must be spent by the end of 2026, according to Heisler. And it’s unclear how the city will continue to support a workforce that has grown by 200 jobs since 2023. At the same time, property reassessments of office buildings and commercial real estate have led to revenue losses and record refunds of property tax payments. The city is also bracing for a potential hit to its so-called jock tax — a levy on visiting athletes and entertainers — which is being challenged in the state Supreme Court. “At a minimum, $20 [million] of the $30 million we’re budgeted to collect in the next five years would be gone,” Heisler said. In October 2024, Shapiro and regional leaders unveiled a $600 million Downtown revitalization plan focusing on converting office buildings, enhancing public spaces and upgrading infrastructure. Gov. Josh Shapiro and Lt. Gov. Austin Davis address the media after a press conference announcing nearly $600 million for Downtown development on Oct. 25, in Downtown. (Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/PublicSource) Reidbord warned about the limitations of that investment. “The Downtown investment is a lot of smoke and mirrors. The state only committed $60 million, not $600 million. A third of that is for one project … that appears to be dead,” Reidbord said, referring to plans to convert the former YWCA of Greater Pittsburgh building on Wood Street into the City Club Apartments. The project appears to be abandoned after the owner’s mortgage default. Downtown is a major driver of the city’s evolving financial situation, Heisler said. “Our Downtown changed forever,” she said. “People aren’t coming Downtown from 9 to 5, Monday to Friday.” With fewer commuters and more remote work, the city is collecting less from its local services tax. “Telework has become way more prevalent,” she said. Converting office buildings into affordable housing As Downtown struggles on multiple fronts, Beacon Communities is working to transform vacant office space into affordable housing. The development firm leverages tax credits, preservation grants and public funding to make these adaptive reuse projects possible — though economic uncertainty is beginning to weigh on the process. “It hasn’t killed deals yet, but it’s definitely in the mix,” said Michael Polite, Beacon’s executive vice president and partner. “… Anxiety leads to pricing increases.” Dusk falls on the skyscrapers of downtown Pittsburgh as seen from the West End Overlook Park on July 2. Light is refracted on the left from a piece of glass. (Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/PublicSource) In January, Beacon and its partners announced the conversion of an office building at 100 First Ave. into 93 one-bedroom apartments for seniors. Once financing is secured, construction moves quickly. “We start right away because of the accrual of loan interest,” he said. Contractors are anticipating volatility. “We do see [subcontractors] that are telling us they are building in a cushion until we get to closing,” he said, adding later that “with adaptive reuse, it’s like any new construction — the cost of materials is going up.” Most of Beacon’s current projects were finalized last year, locking in costs. “Figures are locked in unless it’s a case like COVID,” Polite said. “Now, not everything is bought on day one, so it’s possible there could be some impact as a result of tariffs.” Corrections (7/8): The $24.8 million workforce development grant was incorrectly characterized as an Allegheny Conference on Community Development resource in an earlier version of this story. Record city real estate tax refunds did not exceed total property tax revenues, as suggested in a prior version of this story.
