(Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/PublicSource) City planners and Hill District community members are in the process of  creating a new Greater Hill District Master Plan, a vision statement for several neighborhoods with an emphasis on economic development done in a way to prevent displacement. The Hill District’s original 2011 master plan provided the community and investors with a framework on the community’s priorities for new residential, commercial, cultural and civic development. Efforts to update the plan kicked off in 2020 and despite the COVID shutdown, meetings persisted online between residents and city planning officials. On Tuesday, planners gave the first of two presentations on the new master plan to the City Planning Commission. A second presentation will be held later this month, after which the commission will decide if the master plan should be adopted by the city. “One of the guiding principles is that it will build upon the African American cultural legacy,” said Sharonda Whatley, the Department of City Planning’s assistant director of strategic planning, during her presentation Tuesday to the commission. She explained that the plan had eight community goals. “The Hill is committed to cultivating a neighborhood that excels in livability, celebrates and preserves its rich historical heritage and promotes the health and resilience of all residents,” Whatley said. The plan outlines goals set by the community, such as the desire to ensure all Hill District residents can have all their basic needs met within a 20-minute walk from where they live. To do this, the plan proposes accessibility and community activities on public streets. Whatley also outlined another goal of long–term community resilience through self-sufficiency and representative government. Some of the other goals of the master plan include improving non-car transportation alternatives and building a mix of new and rehabilitated housing without displacing existing residents. City planner Christian Umbach cited the vision statement emphasizing preservation of the current neighborhood while embracing new development through “equitable growth.” The policies set forth include limiting the use of eminent domain and providing co-ownership opportunities. “This would mean essentially encouraging partnerships with local, community-based organizations so that they could share the benefits of development” and preserving space for Hill businesses, Umbach said. This master plan also takes into consideration the cultural and historical legacy of the area by removing what planners characterized as “any remnant of” the Civic Arena, which was built on the site of hundreds of homes, businesses and institutions including the Bethel AME Church , all demolished under eminent domain to make room for the venue.

According to the Hill Community Development Corp., a registered community organization [RCO] that plays a commanding role in the master plan process, the Hill’s will be the last neighborhood-specific blueprint before city planners shift fully to the citywide plan. If approved, the Hill District plan would be incorporated into the city’s zoning code and regulatory framework that would dictate and inform all future Hill developments. The master plan provides the Hill with a framework to direct public, private and institutional resources to support new projects. Much of the plan also emphasizes a need to create a community that is flexible and responsive to changing needs.
