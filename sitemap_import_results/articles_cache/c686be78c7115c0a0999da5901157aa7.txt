Posted in Election 2024 In wake of Trump rally shooting, his Southwestern Pa. supporters are shaken but ‘vibrant’ as elected leaders urge civility The attempt to gun down former President Donald Trump spurred widespread calls for a de-escalation in political rhetoric — but also charges that his foes are “irrational” and war metaphors. by Stephanie Strasburg and Charlie Wolfson July 14, 2024 July 30, 2024 Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X Bill Antesberger, of Forward, waves flags to Route 51 traffic alongside the MAGA Warriors, a group of supporters of former president Donald Trump, Sunday, July 14, 2024, in Elizabeth Township.

Email Δ Midday Sunday, Jae and a couple dozen others gathered on an Elizabeth Township overpass to wave flags and try to make sense of a seismic event they saw less than a day earlier: The candidate they believe will lead America forward was nearly killed by somebody from Allegheny County, practically a neighbor to some attendees. “If [Trump] can do what he did last night, stand up and fight,” Jae said, referring to Trump standing up after the gunfire ended and raising his fist in the air, “this is the least we can do to show support.” Lori Loesekan, center, and her husband, Gordon Pratt, wave flags alongside the MAGA Warriors, a group of supporters of former president Donald Trump, on July 14 in Elizabeth Township. Loesekan was volunteering at the Trump campaign rally in Butler a day prior when shots rang out. She was in the section of the stands where a bystander was killed, said Pratt, who was home watching on TV. “After the gunshots the Secret Service threw me over the bleachers,” she said of the chaos that followed. (Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/PublicSource) Members of the crowd at Sunday’s flag-waving above Route 51 were part of Trump’s core base, many wearing Trump shirts, waving flags with his name or image, and driving cars with pro-Trump stickers. Dan Savage, an organizer of Sunday’s gathering, called Saturday’s shooting “a disgusting stain on America.” He was near the stage at Saturday’s rally when the shooting occurred. “It was just one of those moments, like, wait, this isn’t right,” said Savage, who leads a group of Trump supporters that call themselves MAGA Warriors. After Trump exited the scene, “You could tell that there was crying in the crowd.” Cars pass along  Route 51 below Donald Trump supporters waving flags in support of the former president’s reelection on July 14, in Elizabeth Township. (Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/PublicSource) Susan Gibala, a teacher at  Hempfield Area School District, said she thought the gunshots were fireworks as she watched Trump speak three rows away from the stage. “I’m looking at other people and we’re all just kind of confused,” Gibala said. “At that point … I heard another pop pop pop … At that point, you hear people say, ‘get down, get down,’ so I’m kind of getting moved back and forth.” She said when she saw Trump being moved toward a vehicle, she could see that he did not appear to be seriously wounded, “So I know I’m thanking God, they got his ear, thank you Lord, thank you Lord. He has guardian angels because we’re always praying for him.” Joe McKay, a 61-year-old Baldwin Borough man, said when he watched Trump raising his fist after the shooting on TV, “it put shivers down my spine, man. Tears went to happiness instantly.” Election fraud claims echo after shooting Gibala said the country faces a war going forward. “A spiritual war, for sure,” she said, “but it’s a definite war.” She said the spiritual war is against people in government who are “all about themselves, not about god, country and freedom.” Linkon Haberstock, 7, of Uniontown, poses wearing his political swag alongside the MAGA Warriors, a group of supporters of Donald Trump out waving flags in celebration of the former president on July 14, in Elizabeth Township. (Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/PublicSource) Many flags and stickers seen at Sunday’s gathering promoted debunked theories, pushed by Trump for years, that there was systemic fraud in the 2020 election that caused Trump to lose. Multiple people interviewed by PublicSource expressed belief in those theories, as well as the belief that parts of the government are implacably against Trump. For Savage, Saturday’s violence only strengthened his opposition to what he called a “deep state” that is responsible for government corruption and hindering Trump and his allies.

Honks and cheers of support peppered the air as people organized by the MAGA Warriors group stood in the heat for hours to wave flags from the overpass. (Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/PublicSource) “We’re not going to put up with this anymore,” he said. “I’m stronger inside. I feel vibrant, ready to go. Let’s go, no fear. … America, you need to wake up.” McKay said he considers Allegheny County the “most corrupt county” in the country, citing disproven claims of voter fraud in 2020. Motive unknown Trump was at the Butler Farm Show for a rally in the reliably Republican county north of Pittsburgh. While President Joe Biden narrowly won the battleground state in 2020, Trump took Butler County by a margin of nearly two-to-one. Around six minutes into his remarks, multiple shots were fired from a building outside of the security perimeter. Trump’s ear was grazed, former Buffalo Township Fire Chief Corey Comperatore was shot fatally , and two other people were injured and taken by helicopter to Allegheny General Hospital. Trump on Sunday issued a statement praying for those wounded, honoring Comperatore and urging: “In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United, and show our True Character as Americans, remaining Strong and Determined, and not allowing Evil to Win.” Dan Savage, of Scott Township, pulls up with a thumbs up to Bill’s diner during the final stop for the MAGA Warriors’ “Trump train” on July 14, in Elizabeth Township.

He got choked up talking about the meaning of the flag waving the day after such an event. “This inspires. We’re not going to back down. Never surrender. We are here. We are standing. We are fighting for our grandchildren.” (Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/PublicSource) Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20 , of Bethel Park, was also killed and has been identified as the gunman. Crooks was a registered Republican with a history of a single $15 donation to the left-leaning ActBlue Political Action Committee in 2021. Law enforcement told reporters that a legally purchased AR-15 rifle was used in the shooting and bomb-making materials were found in Crooks’ car parked in Butler and at the home his family has owned since 1998. Biden made a three-minute live statement to reporters shortly after 2 p.m., saying he had no information on the shooter’s motive. He cautioned against speculation. “Let the FBI do their job and the partner agencies do their job,” he urged, pledging a “thorough and swift” probe. Biden also said he was “consistent” in demanding that the government provide Trump with the best possible security. “I’ve directed an independent review of the security at yesterday’s rally,” he said. “We must unite as one nation and demonstrate who we are,” the president added, saying he’ll speak again from the Oval Office tonight. Violence decried Reaction across the political spectrum consisted largely of revulsion at the act, and distress at a toxic political environment that has now turned violent. Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, held a news conference early Sunday afternoon, deferring questions about the investigation into any security lapses that allowed Crooks to get within firing range of Trump while sharing some of his conversations with Biden and with Comperatore’s family, and calling for civility.

My thoughts are with former President Trump and everyone who was injured at rally today in Butler. Political violence is never acceptable. Allegheny County public safety and first responder teams are closely monitoring the situation and offering support on scene. — Allegheny Co. Exec. (@ACE_Innamorato) July 13, 2024 Violence is not the way to resolve our political differences and the actions taken in Butler County have no place in our country. I wish former President Trump a quick recovery and offer our prayers to the family of the other victims. — Mayor Ed Gainey (@MayorEdGainey) July 13, 2024 State Rep. Rob Mercuri, of Pine, who is a Republican nominee for Congress seeking the seat held by Democrat Chris Deluzio, called for unity “and respect for those who disagree with us.” As a country, we need to come together and move forward in unity.
