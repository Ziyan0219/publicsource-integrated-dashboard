Posted in Election 2024 Darkness or dawn? Pittsburgh responds to triumph of Trump, GOP PublicSource asked readers to share their thoughts and feelings about the future following the Nov. 5 general election, which saw Republican Donald Trump defeat Democrat Kamala Harris. by Public Source November 8, 2024 September 24, 2025 Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X Donald Trump’s election to another presidential term, and voters’ lean toward Republicans at the federal and state levels, brought a range of reactions in the Pittsburgh region. It’s a region with deep-blue Pittsburgh at its center, a patchwork of suburbs with ever-shifting partisan tilts whirling through Allegheny County, and increasingly red neighbor counties. On Wednesday, as Democrat Kamala Harris conceded, PublicSource asked readers to tell us how they’re feeling about the future of the country, state or region. Staff made efforts to reach out to people of a variety of political persuasions. Most of the responses ranged from concern to disgust. Some were celebratory. A few urged reflection, in a nonpartisan way. We’ve included nearly all of the responses below, edited for brevity and clarity. (Respondents were free to provide, or omit, their names and other identifying information.) If you do not feel that your perspective is well represented below, we invite you to share your thoughts here , and we may add them. The past years have been full of people not understanding other people. Filled with “us” and “them.” The upcoming years need to be filled with listening and understanding. Leading to “we” and “all.” — Mark Gorman, 73, retired environmental nonprofit and government employee, Bloomfield This is fantastic and inspiring that we can Make America Great Again just like we did eight years ago. — name not provided, 45, president of a community nonprofit organization, Sheraden We must develop a Fourth Estate which informs and reflects exactly what happens. … Four more years of “Trump covfefe” will be insufficient to preserve our democracy. And we must broaden the political spectrum to three full dimensions, not one limited to extremes. — information not provided Terrified. I am considering fleeing the country. … I am scared for my child and her future. I am mourning all the good things I have worked so hard to get in this life that are going to change. The only thing keeping me from fleeing the country is knowing that my family, friends, neighbors, and community are all familiar here. And we will only ever get past this together. — Marylou Lenhart, software engineer, Avalon Community storytelling As Trump takes office on MLK Day, ‘we did it’ meets ‘we must fight back’ From Shaler to East Liberty to Oakland to Downtown, Pittsburghers took stock of a civil rights holiday, a pugnacious inauguration and the road ahead. Pennsylvania failed the nation. The future is bleak with a president devoid of moral principles. Hate is encouraged and vulgarity will reign. I am old and sad that my final years will see the refutation of my optimistic view that this nation has mostly kind citizens. I fear for the future of my children and grandchildren. Good people, there is much work to do to counteract the administration we just elected. — Rebecca & Jim Studer, 83 and 81, retired scientist and engineer Pessimistic. People ignore facts, science, and even what they are seeing with their own eyes. How do you reason with that? — name not provided, 32, Lawrenceville Inside our Newsroom Pittsburgh’s Public Source interns discuss how to cope when news is ‘making you go crazy’ FIRST PERSON Practicing psychiatry left me suicidal. Converting my pickup into an off-roader let me explore the world — and recover mine. Education What is your school’s AI policy? Education Teachers learning to use — not fear — AI Inside our Newsroom Pittsburgh’s Public Source wins national award for impactful democracy-focused reporting I wonder if our country is as mean, petty and fearful of one another as this victor symbolizes. Why are Americans so afraid of, and therefore opposed to, living with “other” people? … My heart is heavy, I’m mourning what I thought would be possible with a President Harris. … Maybe we are the most fearful, self-isolating and stingy people on earth. Time to get to work, whatever path that is. — information not provided The night is darkest before the dawn. But dawn will come. — Andie Grey, community advocate, Beaver County Inside our Newsroom You survived 2024. Now vote one more time — for your must-follow news topics. While the election grabbed attention, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and the Southwestern Pennsylvania region also saw big changes in government spending, housing, energy, the environment, education and health. I’m feeling that we must continue — and intensify — nonpartisan, pro-democracy work. — Greg Laski, 41, writer/scholar, Sewickley Who’d of thunk this wouldn’t work out well? Appointing a deeply flawed candidate (not coming out of a primary process), dismissing all discussion of the Gaza genocide, embracing and campaigning with the likes of the Cheneys, and dismissing average Americans’ financial struggles.

This also might spell the death of any efforts to address climate change. — Connor Griffin, 31, social worker, McKees Rocks I don’t know what to think. … A slim majority of American voters saw fit to elect a self-aggrandizing, convicted felon who has co-opted the presidency and judicial system for his personal gain, to pardon himself and his criminal actors, who has no idea how to solve any of the problems that plague our society. — information not provided I am terrified, disgusted and devastated. I want to nap, so that maybe I can wake up and realize this election (and its results) were all just some horrible nightmare. I fear for the safety and future of my friends, my community, this country. — “E,” Allegheny County I am feeling fantastic. I look at the beautiful, little faces of my grandchildren knowing that my friends and I contributed to providing them the opportunity to live free and make their own decisions on how, where and with whom they want to live without intrusion from big brother government. — Tom Ryan, 72, certified public accountant, Pittsburgh I will never understand people who vote against their own interests. While I get that our system is built to actively prevent us from learning about — and thereby changing — the system, I’m always shocked to see the groups that will be most harmed vote for candidates on the right. — Michael J. Gibson, 36, communications director, Brighton Heights I am disappointed and sad, but not too surprised. I had hoped enough people would side with democracy and fairness for all, but patriarchy, sexism, and racism came to the fore — again. — Susan, 70, part-time interpreter, Friendship Notice how magically, for no apparent reason, the elections that were full of fraud, cheating, illegal immigrants and dead people voting in the millions, are now wonderfully free and fair without a hint of scandal. — Daniel Bair I am discouraged by particular groups within the nation who put self-importance and greed before the good of all and good of our shared planet. Election night I heard the crowd yell, “Give us Barabbas!” … They got him. — name not provided, Pittsburgh I feel optimistic solely because the Trump win seems to be not due to his ability to win more votes but because of the Democrats’ ability to lose votes. If the Dems are able to run a more widely appealing candidate and in a climate where inflation isn’t a big worry, I think they’ll win. — David V. Auth, 27, law graduate student, North Oakland As a senior, I feel so much sadness over the unfinished business we have now pushed on to our children and grandchildren. Every long-term problem we have — from environmental protection to making housing and health care affordable, from strengthening public-sector systems (including Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid) to assuring reproductive rights — is now at greater risk than it was before the election. — Barbara Sieck Taylor, nonprofit executive, East End of Pittsburgh More optimistic federally and statewide than I had been. Looking forward to lower gas and groceries prices. Regionally, I’m concerned that there were no changes in state House and Senate districts that favor conservatives. Also the significant margin which Democrats won by. — Todd McCollum, 54, chairman, City of Pittsburgh Republican Committee, North Side Exhausted and empty. — Christine, 39, nonprofit professional, West View We are circling the bowl at this point. It seems like evil is going to win out. I feel bad for the kids of today because tomorrow is going to have a lot of pain and suffering. — John Sayenga, 63 Extremely anxious about the future of the country and the world. The policies of the incoming Trump administration are unlikely to benefit most Americans and are likely to do great harm to the United States’ relationships with erstwhile international allies. — name not provided, Squirrel Hill It is too soon to ask this. And this is emblematic of the entire problem. Just stop. Breathe. And get back to me next week. — information not provided More Election 2024 coverage Republican David McCormick flips pivotal Pennsylvania Senate seat, ousts Bob Casey Dems’ PA House majority hangs on Cambria County district, where votes are still being counted Election officials encountered problems with misprinted ballots that could not be scanned by machines Tuesday. ‘Something great’ and ‘the world is ending’ echo in post-election din Across the Pittsburgh region, from classrooms to care centers, Donald Trump’s impending return to the White House has shaken perceptions and altered horizons. Trump made gains in much of Pennsylvania — but very little in Allegheny County Most Allegheny County communities hardly changed their voting patterns from the 2020 election. Turnout was down, especially in Democratic areas. MORE STORIES Your gift will keep stories like this coming. Have you learned something new today? Consider supporting our work with a donation.
