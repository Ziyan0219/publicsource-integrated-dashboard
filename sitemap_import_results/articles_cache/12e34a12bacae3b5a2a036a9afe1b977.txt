The 4,485 salaried and non-salaried employees earned a median of roughly $61,000. Of those employees, 724 made more than $100,000. Aggregate data provided by the district revealed gender and racial wage gaps among the workforce. White employees made around $19,000 more than Black employees on average, and men earned about $2,000 more than women on average. The biggest discrepancy was between white men, who earned an average of about $71,000 per year, and Black men, who earned an average of $49,000 per year. White women earned an average of about $68,500 and Black women an average of $50,500. The largest contingent of the workforce — teachers — is predominantly white, with salaries set according to a pay schedule negotiated between the district and the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers.

The students in the district are 69% students of color and predominantly low income . Most teachers (64%) had been with the district since at least 2010.

For example, PPS employed just under 500 classroom aides, 53% of whom are Black, the vast majority of of whom earned between $26,000 and $53,000. Where do PPS teachers live? PPS teachers are allowed to live outside of the city, unlike PPS paraprofessionals who have been advocating for a change to their contract on that point.

For example, five schools in the district have a majority-Black staff that closely mirrors the district’s diversity, including Westinghouse Academy, Lincoln K-5, Faison K-5, Weil K-5 and Miller K-5. By contrast, four schools have less than 10% Black staff, including Phillips K-5, South Brook 6-8, Banksville K-5 and Carmalt K-8. Which schools have the least well paid teachers (i.e the least experience)? Teachers at some schools earn significantly less because they are newer teachers. Teachers at Schiller, for example, made an average salary of $65,000 per year, the lowest in the district. Arlington K-8, Montessori K-5, Spring Hill K-5, Sterret 6-8, Westinghouse 6-12, Allegheny 6-8, King 6-8,  and University Prep at Milliones had the lowest salaries in the district aside from Schiller. Teachers at Roosevelt K-5, the most experienced staff at a school that serves the general population, has an average of 21 years of experience, about three times as much as the least experienced staff at University Prep at Milliones. Only 3% of teachers left the district after the 2020-2021 school year. The district administration, by contrast, saw an exodus in 2021.
