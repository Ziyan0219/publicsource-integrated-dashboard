(Photo by Quinn Glabicki/Pittsburgh's Public Source) ICE agents made multiple arrests at a popular local restaurant chain Thursday morning, following aborted efforts to detain workers there during a late-night sting in June. At least 16 employees spread across two Emiliano’s Mexican Restaurant and Bar locations, in Gibsonia and Cranberry, were detained, the federal agency confirmed in a statement. One employee at the Gibsonia restaurant said they witnessed agents entering with assault rifles and using a battering ram to break into parts of the restaurant, including a door to offices roughly 15 minutes before the restaurant was set to open at 11 a.m. A masked federal agent clears crime scene tape at the rear exit of Emiliano’s after a raid at the Mexican restaurant in Gibsonia on Aug. 7, 2025. (Photo by Quinn Glabicki/Pittsburgh’s Public Source) An ICE spokesperson emailed a statement indicating that ICE, among other agencies, were executing federal court-authorized search warrants based on information that the restaurants were employing undocumented immigrants. “During the execution of the search warrants, 16 individuals were encountered and found to be illegally present in the United States,” the statement read. The raids come amid a rise in immigration enforcement activity across the Pittsburgh region. In response, a growing network of trained local volunteers has mobilized to document ICE operations and support affected families, often racing to scenes at all hours. The action at Emiliano’s follows what witnesses described as an especially intense encounter in Ambridge just last week. By noon Thursday, about 20 volunteers with Casa San José Rapid Response team stood outside the strip mall location of Emiliano’s in Gibsonia, alerted by a call to the organization’s emergency hotline. Volunteers filmed the agents, a number of whom wore masks. An ICE agent talks to a Northern Regional Police officer in the parking lot of Emiliano’s during a raid at the restaurant on Aug. 7, 2025.

Late on June 17, ICE officers surrounded the Gibsonia restaurant , though workers barricaded themselves inside and police left the area after TV crews appeared on the scene. After Thursday’s arrests, Emiliano’s shared a video on social media of an agent inside the restaurant with debris scattered around a back room. “Federal agents stormed our restaurant in a show of force that went far beyond anything reasonable or humane,” the post stated.
