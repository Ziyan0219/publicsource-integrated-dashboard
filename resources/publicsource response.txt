The city regions are: Central Pittsburgh, Hill District, Lower East End, North Side, South Pittsburgh, Southeast Pittsburgh, Upper East End, West End

The county regions (outside of Pittsburgh) are: Alle-Kiski Valley, East suburbs, Mon Valley, North Hills, Northwest suburbs, Ohio River Valley, South Hills, West suburbs

I shared the spreadsheets that laid out the neighborhoods and municipality names and which regions they fit into in the early days, but let us know if you need those again. Should be linked early in our threads though.
