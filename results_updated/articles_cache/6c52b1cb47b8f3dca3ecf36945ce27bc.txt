You will hear us. We will fight for America. Will you?” McLaughlin laid out a list of demands, amounting to one theme: blanket opposition. “No cooperation with Trump’s power grab.” “There is no excuse for Senate Democrats to be confirming any of Trump’s nominees for any agency while this power grab continues.
