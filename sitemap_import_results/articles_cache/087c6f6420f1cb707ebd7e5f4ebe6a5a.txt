Brad Davis) During a two-week mission in Dulab, Iraq, thousands of pounds of unused explosives were found and destroyed by combat engineers. The engineers took the explosives and bunched them together, then placed C-4 explosives on the rounds. The possible improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were detonated at a safe distance.
