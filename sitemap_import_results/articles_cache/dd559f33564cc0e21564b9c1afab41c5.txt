(Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/PublicSource) Advocates for environmental protections say they’re optimistic about the direction of Allegheny County’s Climate Action Plan nine months after some began speaking before council to protest what they deemed a flawed and rushed process. The backlash — spurred by concerns contracts would favor global corporations — led county officials to extend the planning process and convene a public hearing to further engage residents and stakeholders. Now the county has enlisted a slate of consultants that include local groups focused on environment and equity. “The progress of the CAP, how it’s being organized, we feel it is going in the right direction,” said Miguel Sague Jr., a member of the board at the Council of Three Rivers American Indian Center, which is a member of the CAP Justice steering committee. Last month, the county signed a contract with ICF, a multinational management consulting firm that will lead efforts to implement a “year-long engagement and drafting process,” according to a March 14 memo to council. The Climate Action Plan, or CAP, will be “a living plan with concrete action steps that the county intends to energetically pursue,” County Manager John Fournier wrote to council. That will likely include: Countywide strategies for sustainability and decarbonization, including an energy audit of county facilities Measures to improve resiliency and mitigate the risk posed by some of the most acute local symptoms of a warming climate, including landslides and flooding Carbon neutrality targets and steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the county. The county in March signed a $600,000 contract with ICF, which is also leading efforts to update Pennsylvania’s CAP, according to the memo, which noted the firm’s “deep technical abilities” in the fields of climate resilience, environmental planning and infrastructure. Fournier’s memo also listed the international and local organizations that will guide the CAP process over the next 12 months. They are: evolveEA, a local sustainability-focused architecture firm that will lead community engagement strategy Allen + Shariff, an engineering and project management firm headquartered in Maryland with a expertise in climate friendly building Black Girl, Green World, a local environmental justice advocate Na’Toria Marketing and Design Solutions, a Harrisburg-based marketing firm. The county plans a public announcement sometime this month, kicking off community engagement concluding in April 2026 which will prioritize broad geographic representation, environmental justice communities and under-represented voices. After the CAP process was initially launched by County Council ordinance in May 2023, environmental justice advocates expressed concern that without robust participation from local advocacy groups, the CAP would be unlikely to reflect the needs of the community, especially areas most affected by climate change. The county’s choice of contractors has alleviated some fears.
