On event day we need help with taking tickets, readying the space for the event, picking up necessary items and helping sign attendees up for our newsletter.*Ambassadors. Are you going to a meeting or lecture where you might be able to tell people aboutPublicSourceand its work? Could you take a sign-up sheet and invite them to sign up for our free newsletter?*Fundraisers. Events where we raise money for the work ofPublicSourceare lots of fun. But we may need help picking up items that have been donated for our silent auction or taking tickets at the door or making sure the band setup goes smoothly.*Administrative support. Do you have a special talent? Like helping send our stories out on social media or making phone calls to people who might want to sign up for membership?If you have a few hours to spare and can help out as aPublicSourcevolunteer, contact Stephanie Roman atsroman@publicsource.orgwith your name, email address and phone number.We look forward to meeting you!
