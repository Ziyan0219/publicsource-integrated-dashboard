Posted in Trump Impacts No more silence in face of federal funding turmoil, Pittsburgh scientists say Researchers have begun to press their case. Pitt and CMU, though, cite cuts in decision to pull science writers’ conference funding. by Maddy Franklin March 7, 2025 September 24, 2025 Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X Susana da Silva of Point Breeze writes on the backside of a poster board at the Stand Up for Science rally on Friday, March 7, 2025 at Schenley Plaza in Oakland.

A long-planned gathering of science writers, however, will not be coming to Pittsburgh after the city’s two main research universities pulled funding. Some researchers have, in recent weeks, declined to speak with press out of concern that attention could result in targeting by the presidential administration. On Friday, though, a “Stand Up for Science” rally was held in Oakland to broadcast the importance of research, which was called the “lifeblood” of the city. The demonstration, attended by hundreds, was a notable public display for researchers. “That is not normal for our country. You should not be worried that what you’re saying is going to cut your science funding, which is why we have to do this,” said Carrie McDonough, a chemistry professor at Carnegie Mellon University and lead organizer of the rally.

(Photo by Anastasia Busby/PublicSource) McDonough hoped the sheer size of the demonstration would encourage more faculty and scientists to stop “sitting by the sidelines” and start talking about how they’re being impacted. And she’d like to see universities standing behind those who speak out. “You shouldn’t be telling people to be quiet right now,” she said. Several speakers during the protest were quick to note that they were speaking as individuals, not representatives of their employers. Still, they stressed the impact of scientific and medical breakthroughs made at institutions including the University of Pittsburgh and CMU — along with the economic benefits these bring. Pitt and CMU declined to comment when asked by Public Source what any loss of federal funding would spell for the universities and Pittsburgh at-large. Pittsburgh institutions stand to lose nearly $141 million as a result of a cap on funding of indirect costs of National Institutes of Health [NIH]-funded research alone, according to a calculator using fiscal 2024 figures, produced by Data for the Common Good at the University of Chicago. In the wake of stop-work orders affecting clinical trials , gutting of federal agencies and proposed caps on indirect costs funding in NIH grants, both universities seem to have considered cost-saving measures. Pitt sounded alarm bells when it paused Ph.D. admissions last month . These have now restarted, according to university spokesperson Jared Stonesifer.

Science writers event not coming On Thursday, the National Association of Science Writers confirmed that Pitt and CMU had withdrawn their financial commitment to host the group’s annual conference. That decision comes at a time when some say the field is under unprecedented scrutiny. In a statement shared with Public Source, Stonesifer said “recognizing the changing circumstances and need for fiscal prudence while we evaluate the evolving landscape, the University of Pittsburgh regrettably is no longer in a position to co-host” the conference. “We are working with conference organizers to support a smooth transition,” he continued. As for CMU, university spokesperson Cassia Crogan said “the financial impact of federal research funding cuts has had a direct impact on the resources available to host.” U.S. Rep.

Widespread effects The conference’s cancellation wasn’t addressed at Friday’s rally. Instead, speakers focused on the ways research affects their lives or the lives of others through at-risk programs such as research into HIV prevention products for women and trials for medicine that could prolong the lives of people diagnosed with terminal diseases. Many of the Trump administration’s orders regarding federal funding are temporarily stopped by legal challenges. But participants at the rally were urged to “not stay silent” by calling elected officials daily to emphasize the vital role research plays in society. A group of protestors went Downtown after the rally to demonstrate outside of U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick’s office over what they called his lack of response to researchers’ concerns.

Chris, a former employee of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said she could “spit” at the dismantling of her previous workplace, which she said has left biologists and other workers jobless. Her husband, Guy, a retired teacher, said he hoped the rally created “peaceful, forceful resistance” to what he referred to as a “war on the American people.” And daughter Emily wants people with the power to enact change to listen. “Citizens do care about this. This isn’t a niche topic. This is something that’s widespread, that affects everybody.” Maddy Franklin reports on higher ed for Pittsburgh’s Public Source, in partnership with Open Campus, and can be reached at madison@publicsource.org .
