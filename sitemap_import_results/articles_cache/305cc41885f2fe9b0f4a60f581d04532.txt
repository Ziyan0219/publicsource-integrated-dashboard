Posted in Community storytelling PublicSource sets out to meet (and map) Beechview As part of the nonprofit newsroom’s outreach to Pittsburgh’s diverse communities, every member of our staff is reaching out to Beechview’s residents, businesses, organizations and other stakeholders. by Rich Lord July 29, 2023 Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X Beechview is one of Pittsburgh’s vibrant and diverse neighborhoods, and PublicSource wants to get to know your community better. Read the Spanish language version of this post This year, PublicSource laid out plans to deepen connections with Pittsburgh’s communities of color. Among our initiatives: Mapping assets and building relationships in diverse neighborhoods. We started by mapping and chronicling Wilkinsburg’s strengths, and people we met are already informing news stories about that community. Now we’re reaching out to Beechview. In a way, that’s news. But it’s part of a long-running story. Explorations of diversity and equity in Pittsburgh have long been central to the PublicSource newsroom’s mission. ● We track representation within the city and Allegheny County power structure and ask whether Pittsburgh’s diversity — in terms of race, gender and age — are reflected in the halls of power. ● We promote attention to economic mobility by exploring the quality of our schools and access to college. Fair pay? We’re all over it. ● When public agencies offer useful tools and programs, we tell readers through news stories. And we help people to navigate difficult life challenges through public-service guides like this one. ● Through our reporting and that of our media partners, we highlight resources serving the city’s fastest-growing populations. ● When rights are threatened, we amplify vulnerable voices, and when leaders make promises, we document community expectations. We’d love your input on Beechview’s assets we should map and your thoughts on the stories we should share about your community.
