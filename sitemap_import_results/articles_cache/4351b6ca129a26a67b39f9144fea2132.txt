Spring 2017 PublicSource marketing internship PublicSource is a nonprofit online journalism organization in Pittsburgh. It is our mission to listen, to investigate, to reveal the untold stories in the Pittsburgh region. We write stories with powerful narratives and characters to explain complex issues in the areas of criminal justice, the environment, money & politics, health and education. Check us out at PublicSource.org. If you’re interested in what we do, here’s what we’re looking for in an intern: Active participation in brainstorming how to make our community events engaging and ones that people will not want to miss. The ability to take those event ideas and make it a reality. Help us plan it. Organization, time management, accountability. Fresh ideas for promoting PublicSource to different age groups and interests in Pittsburgh. This could be through social media, by attending other events to pass out flyers and talk about what we do … or another unique, surprising idea you may have. Someone game to do market research. What are other groups like us doing to promote their work? What kind of events are they hosting? What businesses are sponsoring them? A desire to identify what skills are unique to you and how to apply it to PublicSource’s mission. PublicSource, a nonprofit newsroom, will pay each intern a $700 stipend for the semester. If you have a professor who will give you credit, we’re happy to fill out the forms. We would prefer an intern to join us for at least 15 hours a week for the entirety of the semester. Our offices are at 746 E. Warrington Ave. in the Allentown neighborhood, right on the bus line. Please send a cover letter, resume and any appropriate work examples by or before Dec. 1 to Halle Stockton at halle@publicsource.org.
