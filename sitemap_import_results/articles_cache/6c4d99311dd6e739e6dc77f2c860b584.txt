DOCUMENTING HATE America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents across the country, so we all know what’s going on. By filling out the form below, you are sharing your story with Documenting Hate , a coalition of organizations led by ProPublica , a nonprofit investigative newsroom. We may share this information with our partner newsrooms around the country, including PublicSource in Pittsburgh, and with some civil rights organizations who are working with us on this project. We will not share your name and contact information with anybody outside our coalition without your permission. We are not law enforcement and will not report this information to the police. The Southern Poverty Law Center recommends you do so directly if you are a victim of a crime. We know that you’ve gone through something traumatic. Thank you for coming forward and telling us what happened.
