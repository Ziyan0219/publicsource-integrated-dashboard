On the 600 block of Boggs Avenue, on Mt. Washington … … an owner who moved in two years ago has a total property tax bill — including school district, city and county levies — of around $5,500. The house next door is slightly smaller, was purchased four years earlier for much less and incurs roughly one-third of the property tax bill. Meanwhile, longtime resident Richard Reiter’s tax bills are below $900.
