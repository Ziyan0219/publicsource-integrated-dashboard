(Photo by Quinn Glabicki/PublicSource) The Allegheny County Board of Health voted Wednesday to substantially increase permitting fees for a range of pollution generating facilities under its Air Quality Program. The proposed changes would amend the county’s Article XXI regulation and alter the Air Quality Program Fee Schedule and the Air Quality Program Asbestos and Abrasive Blasting Fee Schedule . To take effect early next year, the changes must be approved  by the Allegheny County Council. The health board, which oversees the Allegheny County Health Department [ACHD], voted 5-1 in favor of the fee increases. Prior to its Wednesday meeting, the health board held a public hearing and extended a 30-day public comment period. With a total of 162 distinct commenters, 158 expressed support for the proposed changes, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the county controller’s office and multiple environmental advocacy organizations. County council last hiked the fees in 2021, and air quality advocates claim the board’s latest vote as a win. Lisa Graves-Marcucci, coordinator for community outreach at the Environmental Integrity Project, spoke in favor of the fee changes. “Increased fees are essential to ensure ACHD can hire and maintain staff members with expertise in the federal Clean Air Act,” Marcucci said before the vote. “The air program is on loan to us from the federal government, and if we cannot properly meet those standards, including proper staffing and proper funding, we could lose the privilege of the air program.” Increasing permit fees will not only help the department meet budget needs but “will allow the ACHD to properly perform its regulatory function,” said Jay Walker, advocacy coordinator at Clean Air Council.

They also won’t result in emissions reductions or quality-of-life improvements, according to the company. U.S. Steel’s “steelmaking process is done in the safest and most environmentally responsible manner,” the company continued.
