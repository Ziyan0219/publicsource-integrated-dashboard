Posted in Economy & Housing Penn Plaza eviction notices, 10 years ago, energized Pittsburgh’s affordable housing debate Rooted in gentrification, a developer’s push to clear some 200 lower-income households from East Liberty drew opposition and awakened a city to a new driver of displacement. by Eric Jankiewicz and Rich Lord July 28, 2025 September 24, 2025 Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X Lauren Lynch-Novakovic, center, of Knoxville, an organizer with the Pittsburgh Housing Justice Table and allied groups, joined other advocates and former Penn Plaza residents to mark 10 years since eviction notices were first served at the affordable apartments, Monday, July 28, 2025, in East Liberty. Penn Plaza was later demolished to make way for what is now a Whole Foods Market, parking garage, office complex and overgrown field. (Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/Pittsburgh’s Public Source) Penn Plaza crystalized the affordable housing crisis in Pittsburgh like nothing before or since. Displacement wasn’t new to the region. The entire Lower Hill was upended in the 1950s, East Liberty’s urban fabric was shredded in the 1960s, and large public housing communities were eliminated throughout the 1990s. The July 2015 news that 200-plus residents of East Liberty’s two-building Penn Plaza Apartments had 90 days to leave, though, heralded something different from “urban renewal” or Hope VI-funded public housing revamps . It was driven largely by a private developer, LG Realty Advisors, rather than a public entity. It exemplified gentrification, which had not previously been a major point of public discussion in Pittsburgh, after decades of widespread population loss. Residents were more vocal in opposition compared with some prior displacement events. This evening at 6 p.m. at Enright Park in East Liberty, a coalition of neighborhood and community advocacy organizations will mark the 10th anniversary of that process, and “call for affordable housing for all Pittsburghers,” per the announcement of the rally. Here are key milestones in the Penn Plaza evictions and aftermath. 2015 Following nearly five hours of presentations and speakers at a May 15, 2018, meeting, the City Planning Commission voted to approve the Pennley Park South Redevelopment Plan proposed by LG Realty, for the site of the Penn Plaza apartments. LG Realty developers, architects, attorneys and supporters here are pictured leaving the meeting.
