Posted in Shelter Stakes Is ‘500-in-500’ hitting its marks for housing people? Officials, observers weigh in at day 250. Allegheny County’s push to open up 500 units for unhoused people is officially halfway along, logging one-third of the intended affordable dwellings. by Jake Vasilias February 11, 2025 February 12, 2025 Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X Workers from the Center for Employment Opportunities clean up the former tent sites along the Eliza Furnace Trail beside the Allegheny County Jail on Wednesday, Feb. 5, 2025, in Uptown.

(Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/PublicSource) Allegheny County Executive Sara Innamorato’s 500-in-500 program to house people staying in shelters has activated 191 housing units in 250 days, officials said this week. That puts the push past the one-third mark in unit count at halftime. Along the Eliza Furnace Trail Monday, county and City of Pittsburgh officials celebrated the closing of a longstanding trailside encampment, which they said had been the last cluster of tents remaining in the city’s Golden Triangle. Innamorato, Mayor Ed Gainey, county Department of Human Services Director Erin Dalton and community organizer Muhammad Ali Nasir, known as MAN-E, all spoke at the press conference to the synergy between local government departments and community organizers like MAN-E’s Community Care and Resistance in Pittsburgh and Bridge to the Mountains that offered supplies and support to people living along the Eliza Furnace Trail. Dalton praised the efficacy of the program, highlighting how the encampments were cleared without signage or threats, and noting that some other cities have not had the same success. Is the program on track, or behind schedule? Here’s what they’re saying as the effort hits the midpoint of its calendar. The executive: Hundreds housed, tent numbers down Innamorato reported that by the end of January, 278 people were housed, and in addition to the 191 units created there were 50 more “in the pipeline.” She added that the number of tents is the “lowest that they have been in years,” crediting the program.

The mayor: Empty space reflects shared ‘home’ Gainey said the “empty space” of the former encampment symbolizes “that we are very close to ending unsheltered homelessness in the City of Pittsburgh,” and that the program is a demonstration of their commitment to extending prosperity to every Pittsburgher. “Keep Pittsburgh Home” is not just a phrase, but a shared commitment, Gainey said, citing renter protections, eviction defense and affordability. The community organizer: Voices heard, needs met MAN-E said the 500-in-500 program gives unsheltered people agency and restores their dignity, “making sure their voices remain central in this process.” “This was about ensuring that they had real, stable, sheltering housing that met their needs. This was about making sure they had a say in their future and that they were given support necessary to transition into safe, long-term housing,” he said.
