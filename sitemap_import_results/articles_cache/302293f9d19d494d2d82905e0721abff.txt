Posted in HEALTH Parents to UPMC: Tell us whether you’re giving our trans kids’ records to the feds The Department of Justice subpoenaed records of “transgender medical procedures” provided to minors. While some hospital systems fight the records requests, UPMC has been mum, parents say. by Tory Basile September 24, 2025 September 28, 2025 Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X People demonstrate outside UPMC's corporate offices in Downtown during a protest against a new policy limiting gender-affirming care for patients under 19 on June 29, 2025. (Photo by Caleb Kaufman/PublicSource) A group of Pittsburgh parents is urging UPMC Children’s Hospital to protect their children’s privacy following a Department of Justice subpoena they say threatens to expose the young people’s medical records. In July, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) served more than 20 subpoenas to doctors and clinics providing what it called “ transgender medical procedures ” to children. UPMC is among the providers subpoenaed nationwide. Pittsburgh Parents for Medical & Privacy Rights, a group of around 70 local families whose children’s medical records could be at risk, said Tuesday that UPMC “failed to communicate” with them about the subpoena. They said they feel left in the dark, and worried how private medical information could be used against transgender kids and their families. V. Turner, identified by their first initial for safety and privacy concerns, is one of the organizers for the parents’ group. They said the subpoenaed information dates back to January 2020, and estimated 700 people could be impacted. The records include Social Security numbers , addresses and personal communications. Turner said UPMC “made zero effort” to respond to parents, and that multiple families have sent letters and emails to UPMC in the last month without hearing back. The press release quoted a parent, identified only by initials, saying the uncertainty is leaving them fearful. Other regional hospitals, like Boston Children’s Hospital and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, were also subpoenaed — though both have taken legal action to fight the Trump administration. A federal judge blocked the subpoena sent to Boston Children’s on Sept. 9, and the Philadelphia hospital’s challenge , filed July 8, is still being litigated. The Pittsburgh Parents group criticized UPMC for not following suit, and demanded the hospital take similar action to fight the subpoena. The Public Interest Law Center, representing anonymous plaintiffs, filed motions in federal court seeking to quash the subpoenas directed at UPMC and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, on September 24 and Sept. 22 respectively. Another parent identified only by initials faulted UPMC for ending their child’s access to “medically necessary, safe, evidence-based, life-saving care” and then leaving them to worry about privacy. The parent group’s statement was released the same day advocates filed a formal complaint against UPMC, arguing its decision to cease gender-affirming care to transgender youth is discriminatory.

The decision followed a January executive order by President Donald Trump that threatened to defund institutions that performed the “chemical and surgical mutilation of children.” Despite threats to those providers, gender affirming care is still legal in Pennsylvania. Women’s Law Project, a statewide nonprofit legal group, and Berger Montague, a class action law firm, filed the complaint Tuesday to the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission on behalf of five former UPMC patients. The sealed complaint alleges that UPMC’s denial of care to transgender children is discrimination based on sex and disability. According to the Women’s Law Project, cisgender children can still receive puberty blockers or hormone therapy, while trans children can’t. They also argue that refusing to provide care to children with diagnosed gender dysphoria is discrimination based on disability under state law. Security guards walk outside the U.S. Steel Building as protesters lay with cardboard tombstones in front of the doors during a Die In + Funeral to Protect Trans Youth on Sept. 8. The protesters lay outside UPMC’s Downtown headquarters during a moment of silence punctuated by 375 slow drum beats, symbolizing the people who had lost gender affirming care after UPMC’s June decision to end those services for people under 19, following a federal executive order. (Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/Pittsburgh’s Public Source) In an emailed statement, UPMC said it “remains steadfast in our commitment to providing exceptional care for all patients.” It did not answer specific questions about whether cisgender patients were still receiving hormone therapy or similar care, or about its response to the DOJ subpoena. “As we continue to monitor any executive branch memos, directives, subpoenas and other guidance from the Trump administration, these actions have made it abundantly clear that our clinicians can no longer provide certain types of gender-affirming care without risk of criminal prosecution,” the statement read. “This includes specific restrictions on puberty blockers and hormone therapy for individuals under the age of 19. However, we will continue to provide essential behavioral health support and other necessary care within the bounds of the law while seeking to protect the confidentiality of the physician/patient relationship. We empathize deeply with the patients and families affected by these ongoing changes.” The complaint will be investigated by the commission, which will gather facts to determine whether there is reason to believe UPMC’s actions are discriminatory. If the commission finds probable cause, it will work to settle the case. Annmarie Pinarski, a WLP attorney, said her clients’ hope is that the complaint will lead UPMC to restore gender-affirming treatment.
