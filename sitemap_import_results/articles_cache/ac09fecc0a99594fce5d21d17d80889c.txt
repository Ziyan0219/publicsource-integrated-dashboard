A one-of-a-kind ecosystem lies above the bauxite Alcoa says it needs for its future. The company’s request to expand mining in Australia is drawing objections from scientists and the land’s original inhabitants. From 7,000 feet, the reddish ruts dug by one of the world’s largest bauxite mines cut for miles through an endangered biodiversity hotspot. The ore beneath Australia’s Northern Jarrah Forest fuels Alcoa’s $12 billion global aluminum operation. As demand surges, the Pittsburgh-based metals giant wants approval to mine more land. But the forest has already been taken to its knees by a warming world and decades of deforestation. Scientists say further loss threatens total ecological collapse.
