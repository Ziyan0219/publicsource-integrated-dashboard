Posted in Unbalanced Push for property tax reassessment likely to continue, per Pittsburgh schools’ top lawyer A day after a judge’s decision to dismiss a lawsuit by PPS against Allegheny County, options for the district include an appeal and expansion of a lawsuit by a homeowner. by Lajja Mistry February 14, 2025 February 14, 2025 Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X The Pittsburgh Public Schools Administration building located on South Bellefield Avenue in Oakland.

The top lawyer for the Pittsburgh Public Schools suggested Friday that the district’s push for a countywide property tax reassessment has not ended with a judge’s dismissal this week of a 10-month-old PPS lawsuit. Solicitor Ira Weiss said PPS is evaluating options which may include appealing a judge’s decision in favor of Allegheny County. He added that a separate lawsuit filed last month, in which a Churchill homeowner is challenging the fairness of the county’s property tax system, may expand. That case is not affected by the decision against PPS. Other parties have expressed interest in the homeowner’s lawsuit and may join the case “a little bit down the road,” said Weiss, who is representing the homeowner. PPS sued the county last April , claiming that it is being fiscally harmed by uneven property tax assessments. The district projected an operating deficit of $28 million during its budget presentation last year. With declining enrollment and rising overhead costs, the district is also considering closing and consolidating schools in the upcoming years. In an opinion this week, Common Pleas Judge Kenneth Valasek wrote that the district had not met its burden to prove that the county’s assessments violate the state constitution’s clause requiring that taxes be applied uniformly, or that equal protection had been violated. Similarly, the judge found that even if varied assessments compel the district to make payments to property owners who win assessment appeals, that performance of its statutory duties would not constitute “harm.” The judge added in the decision’s final paragraph that the ruling “should not be interpreted to mean that Allegheny County’s current assessments are constitutionally permissible.” We are local reporters who tell local stories.

The second-year executive has not yet taken public steps to reassess. The county budget this year relies on an across-the-board hike in the tax rate, applied to the existing, widely varied assessments. Weiss said that’s not fair. “While I respect the opinion of the court, this notion of raising taxes this way to solve this problem is ill-conceived,” he said. “Raising taxes on an inequitable, unconstitutional assessment system only worsens the problem. It doesn’t cure it.” Weiss said the district would start making decisions for further steps next week.
