Volunteer If you’re a fan of the in-depth news PublicSource provides, volunteering is a great way to support our work and get to know us. If you’re interested in becoming a volunteer, please email Stephanie Roman at sroman@publicsource.org . Include your name, email address and phone number in your email so we can contact you when we need volunteers. And let us know which of these opportunities you’re interested in. Here are some of the things you might be able to help us with: *Events. PublicSource has events to discuss the subjects of our stories — usually with panelists who are experts on the issue — and engage the community about their questions. On event day we need help with taking tickets, readying the space for the event, picking up necessary items and helping sign attendees up for our newsletter. *Ambassadors. Are you going to a meeting or lecture where you might be able to tell people about PublicSource and its work? Could you take a sign-up sheet and invite them to sign up for our free newsletter? *Fundraisers. Events where we raise money for the work of PublicSource are lots of fun. But we may need help picking up items that have been donated for our silent auction or taking tickets at the door or making sure the band setup goes smoothly. *Administrative support. Do you have a special talent? Like helping send our stories out on social media or making phone calls to people who might want to sign up for membership? If you have a few hours to spare and can help out as a PublicSource volunteer, contact Stephanie Roman at sroman@publicsource.org with your name, email address and phone number. We look forward to meeting you!
