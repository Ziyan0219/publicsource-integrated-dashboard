The shelter includes 95 beds in group sleeping rooms, 43 single-room-occupancy units, emergency shelter space, an engagement center and a medical clinic. People who were staying there had to be relocated after the June fire and they will begin to move back in on Oct. 28. The engagement center is slated to reopen the next day with operations  from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. The winter shelter plan will run between Nov. 15 and March 15, involving at least five providers across Pittsburgh working with the county to offer 105 supplemental beds for single adults, according to Allegheny County Department of Human Services Director Erin Dalton.

According to the department’s data dashboard, another 713 people — including 377 single adults — are using emergency shelters across the county.

In selecting the Perry South location, the county is solidifying a decision made last year to shelve the traditional winter shelter in the Smithfield United Church of Christ , Downtown. Last year marked the first winter season in decades in which the county declined to open the longtime emergency winter shelter in Downtown. The county will offer a free shuttle to the new shelter in Perry South from Second Avenue Commons. “Our goal is to ensure that no one has to spend a night out in the cold,” Dalton said, noting that the county will not be using the Code Blue system that was put in place last year. Under that system, emergency shelter opened when temperatures dropped below 26 degrees between the hours of 4 p.m. and 8 a.m. “I’m so pleased that this year we will not need a Code Blue protocol for people experiencing homelessness because shelter and daytime supports will be open every day, all winter, and not just on the coldest nights of the year,” Dalton said.

Around 12 people had been staying in tents in the parklet, according to the city.

Dalton said that there will be fewer barriers to entry to the Perry South shelter, which will be located at the Community Resource Mall on Maple Avenue.
