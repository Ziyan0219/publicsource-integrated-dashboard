Posted in Election 2024 Election Day 2024: From the polls to the warehouse, more energy than anxiety From the presidency to control of Congress and Harrisburg, Western Pa. voters have heavy decisions to make today. Polls are open until 8 p.m., and PublicSource will be updating this page all day. by Public Source November 5, 2024 November 6, 2024 Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X A bitterly contested and unpredictable election year culminates today, with voters in the all-important swing state of Pennsylvania casting ballots through 8 p.m. Control of the White House, Congress and Pennsylvania General Assembly may not be clear tonight. More than 1.5 million Pennsylvanians have already voted by mail and millions more are expected at the polls today, potentially determining whether Vice President Kamala Harris will ascend to the Oval Office or former President Donald Trump will return to power. The latest news from the PublicSource team will appear here throughout the day. David Ely and his fiancee Halle Burgunder watch election results come in at Sen.

The two had traveled from Philadelphia to support the groundwork efforts in Southwestern Pennsylvania. “We’ve done pretty much everything we can do on Black middle class communities,” said Cruz, after trying to rally her fellow organizers for a group photo. “Our organization has hit on over 600,000 doors and made over 1.4 million phone calls statewide.” One PA organizers Sage Cruz, left, engagement director, and Nydea Graves, both of Philadelphia, watch the election results come in at a Thank You Allegheny County party at TLC Libations on Election Day, Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024, in Homewood. “We’ve done pretty much everything we can do on Black middle class communities. Our organization has hit on over 600,000 doors and made over 1.4 million phone calls statewide,” said Cruz. (Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/PublicSource) Beside Cruz, scrolling through poll results in a camo Harris-Walz hat, Graves kept up her faith in Pennsylvanians’ long commitment to the fight for democracy. The battles of Gettysburg, the creation of the Declaration of Independence, the historic labor organizing in Pittsburgh’s steel vallies, even the Underground Railroad stop underneath her Philadelphia high school.  “These are all places where Pennsylvania’s have fought over and over again for our democracy,” she said. “We’ve done too much in this state to not feel optimistic.” As the party wrapped around 10:30, she carried that optimism and the recent memory of their hard work to the elevator. “An endorsement is like a double edge sword,” she said of the organization’s support of Harris. “We will work hard to get you elected, but we’ll work just as hard to hold you accountable to our communities.” Wesley Porter Washington Gadsden, center, of Wilkinsburg, looks at the polls on his phone at a Thank You Allegheny County party at TLC Libations on Election Day, Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024, in Homewood.

In terms of the ground game, I think we’ve done everything we can possibly do right now,” he said.

Devlin Robinson, R-Bridgeville, declared victory to a roomful of supporters at a golf club in Pittsburgh’s eastern suburbs. “I am honored, I am grateful,” he said. “And I’m ready to continue the fight. It’s a fight for government that serves the people. Not the other way around. It’s a fight to apply the brakes on runaway taxes and enact policies that reduce inflation. It’s a fight for a prosperous economy for working families. I’m grateful to every one of you.” Sen. Devlin Robinson R-Bridgville gives his victory speech at his watch party on Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024, at the Hickory Heights Golf Club in Bridgeville. (Photo by Anastasia Busby/PublicSource) Robinson thanked small business owners, combat veterans and the “hard-working union members who know that good jobs don’t have a party.” The Associated Press has not yet called the race, with Robinson leading by a roughly 5% margin and 10% of ballots still to count. Dick Jewell began raising funds for political candidates in the 1980s for state Auditor General and now, nearing 80, he serves as Robinson’s finance chair. Jewell said he was first introduced to Robinson during the senator’s first run four years ago. “Robinson is one of the hardest working people I know,” Jewell said. “He did all the grunt work for his first term” Jewell said Robinson is unmarried with a girlfriend, allowing him to prioritize public life above most candidates he’s worked for. “I’d love to see him rise to senior leadership,” Jewell added. Looking up the ballot, Jewell characterized the presidential matchup as unprecedented. “This presidential election is very different because Trump is unique and she [Kamala Harris] arrived on the scene some 65 days ago,” he said. “Nobody alive today has ever experienced anything like this.” In either outcome, Jewell said, the country will need “a lot of healing.” “I’ve never seen partisanship so ugly.” “Calling someone a liar has become so devalued. In the old, old days if you called someone a liar that might end up in a duel.” Trump is narrowly leading Pa with about 55% ballots counted but much of the remaining votes are in deep Blue Philly and its suburbs — JamieWiggan (@JamieWiggan) November 6, 2024 With 86% of Allegheny County's vote reporting, Kamala has just fallen a hair below Biden's 2020 margin in the county. Not finalized yet of course. — Charlie Wolfson (@chwolfson) November 6, 2024 U.S. Rep. Summer Lee talks with our Audience Intern Evans Toviave after her reelection on Nov. 5.

(Photo by Anastasia Busby/PublicSource) Concerns over immigration and the economy led John Kindler, 65, to vote for Trump this evening. “I want the country to be like it used to be,” he said. “I think our border security is weak and the economy is being neglected.” Kindler also voiced support for fossil fuel extraction, which he said would receive a boost under Trump’s leadership and spur economic growth. “When he was president we had strong overseas policy and our unemployment was low.” Kindler said he’s not sold on Trump’s character, describing the former president as an “idiot,” though he believes “his policies are great.” Charles Miller, 57, said women’s rights were a deciding factor in his vote for Kamala Harris tonight. “It’s pretty obvious that she would be the one to support,” Miller said. The right for women to determine their health care choices is important to Miller, who said under Trump the “opposite would happen,” referencing the overturning of Roe v. Wade by a Supreme Court flipped by Trump appointees. At the Skyview Volunteer Fire Company polling site in West Mifflin, Judge of Elections Ashley Curry said that a lot of first-time voters have cast ballots at the precinct today. pic.twitter.com/c5zYsu8fnP — PublicSource (@PublicSourcePA) November 6, 2024 The polling location at Skyview Volunteer Fire Department on Election Day, Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024, in West Mifflin.

Judge of Elections Ashley Curry got some fresh air outside as two quads drove past the sloping road out front. Some years the vote count at the fire house is not much over 100, but this year, “we’re past over 500 votes. A lot of people are coming out to vote this election. Lots of 18-year-olds, lots of first-time voters. “Considering the small little region we cover, everyone got out to vote today. Everyone’s been really cool, calm.” Ram Luitel, a Trump voter in West Mifflin, shares with our Audience Intern Evans Toviave that his top issues this election are the economy and border control. pic.twitter.com/BA7R4fJn4T — PublicSource (@PublicSourcePA) November 6, 2024 Cindy Fadzen stands in front of the polling location in the Beechview Healthy Active Living Center Nov. 5, 2024. “You just don’t know what to believe with the Democrats,” Fadzen said. “Kamala’s been in office for four years now and she hasn’t gotten anything done that she could have.” (Photo by Cameron Croston/PublicSource) Beechview Healthy Active Living Center doubles as a polling location on Nov. 5.

(Photo by Cameron Croston/PublicSource) Amber Frantz and Maddy Franklin, Oakland Career Center, 3:45 p.m. Maddy and I are wrapping up our coverage, ending the day at Oakland Career Center where a once-lengthy line has dwindled down to a 15-minute wait. Over the last hour, we caught up with several voters, all of whom were men who voted for Harris. Andrew Jeannot, 20, was the first person today to mention that changes to DEI policies were a decisive factor in capturing his vote. As a Black man, he noted Trump’s increasing influence among his demographic and has found himself in debates about Trump’s leadership. Sheridan McHenry, a member of the IBEW Local #5 Union, expressed similar concerns about Trump. McHenry said he voted for Harris because Trump is “against unions.” We finished the day by talking with Erik Leonard, 21, who stuck to his “liberal family” roots in voting for Harris. While Leonard says he hasn’t paid attention to pre-election coverage, he will “keep an eye out” for the results, but there will be no election watch parties in his evening. Maddy Franklin, Oakland Career Center, 3:11 p.m. Editorial intern Amber Frantz and I have journeyed away from Pitt’s campus, where voting activity appeared to be dwindling. Now, we’re outside of the Oakland Career Center, a popular polling location for students who live off campus. Here, the line wraps around the building, and we’ve been told that the wait was up to an hour and a half in some cases. Arti and Morgan, 20-year-olds who declined to give their last names, said they observed no issues with the voting process here but had seen a few people come to the center to cast a ballot who were then redirected to other locations. University of Pittsburgh students Morgan and Arti, who both declined to share their last names, voted for Harris at the Oakland Career Center on Nov. 5. (Photo by Amber Frantz/PublicSource) Both women said they voted for Harris, with Arti mentioning Harris’ plan to back the middle class and being the daughter of immigrant parents as being some deciding factors for her. Morgan cited Harris’ stances on reproductive health, particularly access to IVF, and LGBTQ+ rights as securing her vote. “I’m a gay woman. Being in the society right now, I feel as though Donald Trump is a villain in my story,” Morgan said. Venuri Siriwardane, Allegheny County elections warehouse, North Side, 2:38 p.m. Around 200 Allegheny County employees are in the final stages of pre-canvassing some 225,000 mail-in ballots. Pre-canvassing is the process of preparing ballots before they’re officially returned. To make it easier to quickly tabulate results, workers check outer envelopes, verify signatures, remove ballots from inner, secrecy envelopes and inspect them for errors. (Canvassing, which follows, involves making sure that every valid ballot is counted.) As of 2:20 p.m., all secrecy envelopes have been extracted from outer envelopes. Ballots were being scanned by 10 scanning machines here in the warehouse. County spokesperson Abby Gardner expected pre-canvassing to wrap up shortly, at which point most workers will be dismissed. Some workers will remain to process ballots that the U.S. Postal Service delivers to the warehouse by 8 p.m. Two monitors mounted on a wall show the scanning and tabulation process. The lower leftmost feed shows the scanning process, while the feed next to it on the right shows the tabulation room. This morning, according to Gardner and others, two Republican poll watchers attempted to observe the pre-canvassing using binoculars. The county stopped them from doing so, after which GOP attorneys in Courtroom 709 of the City-County Building negotiated with the county. The poll watchers may use binoculars, but not while ballots are being extracted from secrecy envelopes, and not in the area where votes are being scanned. Neither the dispute nor the agreement are believed to have reached the level of a formal court motion. Monitors mounted on a wall at the Allegheny County elections warehouse show the scanning and tabulation process. The lower leftmost feed shows the scanning process, while the feed next to it on the right shows the tabulation room.

Gen Z favorite artists Chappell Roan and Charli XCX have supplied background music for students passing through William Pitt Union Plaza. Most of the students I’ve talked to say campus is generally lively today, but friends Anjola Oludayo and Maria Hernandez Castaneda said they felt it was unusually quiet. They chalked that up to classes being virtual, though. The friends said they felt surprisingly safe given the high stakes of the close-polling presidential race. “While a lot of people don’t agree with everything [Harris] is for, she’s still allowing us to keep the right to disagree with her and not tell us to follow something,” Hernandez-Castaneda said. “She is democracy,” Oludayo added. Democracy also came up with other students I talked to, like 21-year-old Angie Opoku, who said it felt “liberating” to vote as a Black woman on campus. Derek Haeussler, 20, said it felt “surreal” to cast a ballot in his first presidential election. Climate change and abortion rights came in as top issues for many. For others, students’ rights, voter’s rights and the humanitarian crisis in Palestine, were front of mind as they cast their ballots. Charlie Wolfson, PublicSource newsroom, 1:18 p.m. We are on the lookout for problems with the administration of today’s election — both legitimate complaints and attempts to misinform the public. One misleading claim was debunked earlier today by Allegheny County Councilman Sam DeMarco, the chairman of the county’s Republican committee. He clarified that a picture circulated on social media claiming to show Pennsylvania ballots pre-marked in favor of Harris did not resemble Pennsylvania ballots at all, and contained candidates that do not appear on the state’s ballots. “Don’t buy into these false claims and please don’t spread them,” DeMarco wrote. As of noon, all outer envelopes of mail in ballots in the warehouse have been opened. Inner envelopes are being opened and workers are extracting ballots from inner envelopes. The scanning of ballots for tabulation has begun. Results will not be posted until after 8 pm. — Allegheny County (@Allegheny_Co) November 5, 2024 Any voter who still has a mail-in ballot should not put it in the mail. Ballots must be received by the county by 8 p.m. today, and having a postmark by that time does not qualify. Ballots placed in the mail today will not be counted. https://t.co/6GmSAmqBqM — PublicSource (@PublicSourcePA) November 5, 2024 Cameron Croston, Soldiers & Sailors, Oakland, 12:30 p.m. The Allegheny County Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall & Museum serves as a polling location for many University of Pittsburgh students on Nov. 5. Physics student Ethan Trexler poses for a portrait in front of the Soliders & Sailors. “I’d say I’m more voting against Trump than for Kamala. I consider myself an activist and I think one of these candidates will allow that activism to continue than the other,” Trexler said. Sophie Stefancic poses for a portrait in front of the Soliders & Sailors. A sign encouraging voting at “Election Fest” on Pitt’s campus in Pittsburgh’s Oakland neighborhood, on Nov. 5. Maddy Franklin, William Pitt Union, Oakland, 11:45 a.m. While the Pitt campus gears up for an Election Fest just outside of William Pitt Union at noon, I heard many students asking each other if they voted. Max Silver, 19, walked out of WPU proclaiming he’d just “voted for the G.O.A.T.” on a phone call. Who’s the greatest of all time? Harris, he said, but that’s not to say he agrees with all of her policies. Silver thinks Trump has a stronger plan for the southern border, but on “healthcare, interstate needs and the overall needs of people in the country,” Harris has him beat. Some students on Pitt’s campus weren’t nervous, including 21-year-old Anagha Venkatesh who said it was exciting to vote in a presidential election for the first time. As a person with Indian roots, sharing a cultural connection with Kamala Harris — who has both Indian and Jamaican roots — made it all the more special. As a kid, she said she never imagined it happening. Charlie Wolfson, Montour High School, Robinson, 10 a.m. Sarah S., a 34-year-old Robinson woman who declined to share her last name, said she is voting Republican for the first time this election, including a vote at the top of the ticket for Trump. “I think over the past couple years there’s been a dangerous precedent set with trying to suppress freedom of speech,” she said outside her polling place at Montour High School. She added that she was disturbed by the recent slaying of a police officer on a trail she uses often; local Republicans are blaming a progressive magistrate for releasing the suspect on non-monetary bond in 2023. Another Robinson woman, 46-year-old April Hoffman, said she voted for Trump today because of the economy and border security. She said she has voted Republican the last couple elections but not always up and down the ballot. Both women said they vote in every election. You count on us for factual information.

Outside of Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall and Museum, 21-year-old Sophie Stefancic and 19-year-old Bree Francis had set up a station on behalf of the organization Feminist’s Majority. As a biology and pre-med major, Stefancic is concerned with securing reproductive rights, which compelled her to get involved in voter engagement efforts. University of Pittsburgh students Jocelyn Crowell, Sophie Stefancic and Bree Francis operate a table for the Feminist Majority Foundation outside Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall and Museum in Oakland on the morning of Nov. 5. (Photo by Maddy Franklin/PublicSource) Francis feels this election is a decisive one for “the future of the country,” and for her, living in Pennsylvania has only heightened its importance. The women say they’ve been well-received on campus, which was evidenced by cars honking as they drove by their “Honk for Harris” sign. “Every time they [honk], it’s like, OK, we’re not out here by ourselves. They are people behind us and that’s a really encouraging feeling, knowing that there’s other people out here that not just agree with us but are willing to honk in the middle of the busiest intersection in town and say ‘I agree with you, I’m with you, I’m here with you.’” Cameron Croston, Swissvale Community Food Bank, Swissvale, 10:40 a.m. I’ll be roving the city and near suburbs for PublicSource today, capturing the electoral process in images.

There are around two dozen professionals in the courtroom, presumably including attorneys, and they’re huddled up talking about provisional ballots. But there’s no formal argument or motion at this time, and the judge is not yet on the bench. I’m Charlie Wolfson, and I’ll be monitoring the voting process all day here at PublicSource. Allegheny County’s 1,327 polls opened at 7 a.m., and almost all of them opened on time and without incident. According to county spokesperson Abigail Gardner, two precincts were delayed. Whitehall’s 3rd precinct opened late because the judge of elections was late, but it was open as of 8:20 a.m. In Pittsburgh 31-03, a Lincoln Place precinct, the poll book was missing because the judge of elections was absent. As of 8:15 voters were able to cast provisional ballots, Gardner said, and the sheriff was in the process of delivering the poll book to restore normal operations. In the county’s election warehouse, 200 county employees were sworn in at 7 a.m. to begin opening more than 215,000 mail-in ballots that have already been returned by voters. Throughout the day the ballots will be extracted, flattened and scanned, and the county expects to report mail-in ballot results around 8 p.m. High-stakes choices await local voters up and down the ballot today, with the presidential contest far from the only big decision.

Bob Casey, a Scranton Democrat, is running for a fourth term in a close race with Republican Dave McCormick, a former hedge fund manager who lives in Pittsburgh. Democrats have just a one-seat majority in the Senate, and a tough national map means the party can’t afford to lose Casey’s seat if they hope to retain the upper chamber. The U.S. House, meanwhile, is just as narrowly divided as the Senate and could also come down to Pennsylvania voters. The 17th District, the only competitive seat in the western part of the commonwealth, includes some Allegheny County suburbs and all of Beaver County. Incumbent Rep. Chris Deluzio, an Aspinwall Democrat, is trying to fend off Pine Republican state Rep. Rob Mercuri and win a second term. Deluzio won the district by 7 points in 2022. Election 2024 Trump doubts election integrity while Harris champions reproductive rights on election eve in Pittsburgh Pittsburgh hosts Trump rally and nearby Harris event ahead of Tuesday polls. Of a handful of “must win” districts to decide control of the state Senate, two are in Allegheny County. The suburban 37th District, where Democrat Nicole Ruscitto challenges Republican Sen. Devlin Robinson , is one of three that Democrats are trying to flip in order to take control. The Mon Valley-centric 45th District, which state Rep. Nick Pisciottano is trying to keep in Democratic hands against Republican Jen Dintini, is the Republicans’ best shot at a pickup. The state House is even more narrowly divided, with Democrats holding an edge of 102 seats to 101. Allegheny County’s suburban 28th, 30th, 33rd and 44th districts will be key to the outcome in that chamber.

Most have already returned them to the county, which stores them in a secure warehouse until Election Day morning, when they are opened and counted. Any voter who still has a mail-in ballot should not put it in the mail. Ballots must be received by the county by 8 p.m. today, and having a postmark by that time does not qualify. Ballots placed in the mail today will not be counted. Election 2024 How votes are counted in Allegheny County Multiple backups ensure election results are safely and accurately recorded as hundreds of thousands of ballots are scanned during the 2024 presidential election. To see if the county has received a mail-in ballot, use this state tracking website . A voter possessing a mail-in ballot today has options to make their vote count. They can deliver it to the Allegheny County office building at 542 Forbes Ave., Downtown. (A voter can only deliver their own ballot this way.) Voters can also turn in their mail-in ballot and pre-addressed envelope at their local polling place and vote there. If a voter has lost their mail-in ballot or has reason to believe the county will not receive it on time, they can go to their local polling place and ask to vote via a provisional ballot. The county will set the provisional ballot aside and count it after verifying that the same voter did not return a mail-in ballot. What’s on my ballot?

Here are 6 low- or no-cost ways to destress in Pittsburgh From Black Cat Market to Randyland, Pittsburgh and Allegheny County offer plenty of options for escaping the polls and punditry. Other counties can take longer to report mail-in ballots. Philadelphia County officials have warned that it may not have complete results by day’s end. While votes will almost certainly not be fully tabulated by the end of today, there is a possibility that media organizations such as the Associated Press will have enough data to declare winners tonight. In the nationwide race for president, the timeline is murkier. The outcome could come down to states that are slower to count votes, like Arizona or Nevada. How are votes counted? Where your ballot is scanned depends on how you cast it. Votes cast in person on Election Day are scanned at local voting precincts, and mail-in ballots are scanned at a central warehouse run by county employees. The counting process begins at 7 a.m. on Election Day when county employees begin the process of opening and scanning more than 200,000 mail-in ballots at a county-run warehouse. View this post on Instagram A post shared by PublicSource | Pittsburgh news (@publicsource) This warehouse has been under guard around the clock since ballots arrived, and a county official said there will be a large police presence inside and outside the building on Election Day. Mail-in ballot envelopes are checked twice for a proper date and signature before being opened and then the ballots within are fed into high-speed scanners that can process 50,000 sheets per hour. The scanners load results onto two USB drives and the ballots themselves are kept as a backup. Since the scanners are in the same building as the election night reporting network, the county is usually able to upload the results from these ballots almost immediately after polls close. There are 1,327 voting precincts in Allegheny County, spread among 766 locations (some locations house multiple precincts). Each precinct has a ballot scanner, a machine to help people with disabilities mark ballots, and enough ballots for the voters who reside there. Voters mark paper ballots with pens and feed the marked ballots into a scanner, which tallies the votes for each contest. The ballots are kept in a secure box inside the scanner to serve as a backup to the tally. After polls close at 8 p.m., poll workers remove two USB drives from the scanner containing the results for that precinct and deliver them to Elections Division officials posted at one of eight drop-off sites. One drive is considered unofficial and is uploaded to the internet that night so the public can see the results quickly. The other, considered official, is loaded into the county’s closed network which never connects to the internet. The drives from the mail-in ballot scanners are handled the same way. The ballot scanners also print strips of paper showing the results for the relevant precinct; one is posted outside the polling place and copies are also kept by poll workers and county officials. In all, precinct results are recorded four different ways: The set of paper ballots, the two USB drives and the printouts. As USB drives from precincts are delivered, results will be uploaded to the county website and news organizations like the Associated Press can begin to declare winners. PublicSource relies on Associated Press determinations to report election winners. While it’s likely that all mail-in ballots and more than 90% of Election Day ballots in Allegheny County will be counted and reported by Wednesday morning, the counting and certification process will be far from finished. On Friday, the official Return Board will be sworn in, and it will verify that the number of people who signed into each precinct matches the number of votes at each. The board will also examine provisional ballots and determine which ones should be fully or partially counted. The county Board of Elections is tentatively scheduled to certify the election results on Nov. 25. Read more about Election 2024 Find all of PublicSource’s 2024 election coverage on this page .

<p>Lit by the glow of the CBS News broadcast, One PA organizers Sage Cruz and Nydea Graves sat quietly side by side as the bartender behind them closed up. The two had traveled from Philadelphia to support the groundwork efforts in Southwestern Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“We’ve done pretty much everything we can do on Black middle class communities,” said Cruz, after trying to rally her fellow organizers for a group photo. “Our organization has hit on over 600,000 doors and made over 1.4 million phone calls statewide.”&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.publicsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241105-Election-Day-Results-Allegheny-County-16.jpg" alt="A group of people, casually dressed, sit and stand in a room.

Our organization has hit on over 600,000 doors and made over 1.4 million phone calls statewide,” said Cruz. (Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/PublicSource)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Beside Cruz, scrolling through poll results in a camo Harris-Walz hat, Graves kept up her faith in Pennsylvanians’ long commitment to the fight for democracy. The battles of Gettysburg, the creation of the Declaration of Independence, the historic labor organizing in Pittsburgh’s steel vallies, even the Underground Railroad stop underneath her Philadelphia high school.&nbsp; “These are all places where Pennsylvania’s have fought over and over again for our democracy,” she said. “We’ve done too much in this state to not feel optimistic.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the party wrapped around 10:30, she carried that optimism and the recent memory of their hard work to the elevator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“An endorsement is like a double edge sword,” she said of the organization’s support of Harris.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We will work hard to get you elected, but we’ll work just as hard to hold you accountable to our communities.”</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:20px">Eric Jankiewicz, Hickory Heights Golf Club, South Fayette, 10:45 p.m.</h5>
<p>State Sen. Devlin Robinson, R-Bridgeville, declared victory to a roomful of supporters at a golf club in Pittsburgh’s eastern suburbs.</p>
<p>“I am honored, I am grateful,” he said. “And I’m ready to continue the fight. It’s a fight for government that serves the people. Not the other way around. It’s a fight to apply the brakes on runaway taxes and enact policies that reduce inflation. It’s a fight for a prosperous economy for working families. I’m grateful to every one of you.”&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.publicsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/11052024_DevlinRobinson_AB_445.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1312390" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Sen.

<p>Robinson thanked small business owners, combat veterans and the “hard-working union members who know that good jobs don’t have a party.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Associated Press has not yet called the race, with Robinson leading by a roughly 5% margin and 10% of ballots still to count.</p>
<p>Dick Jewell began raising funds for political candidates in the 1980s for state Auditor General and now, nearing 80, he serves as Robinson’s finance chair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jewell said he was first introduced to Robinson during the senator’s first run four years ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Robinson is one of the hardest working people I know,” Jewell said. “He did all the grunt work for his first term”</p>
<p>Jewell said Robinson is unmarried with a girlfriend, allowing him to prioritize public life above most candidates he’s worked for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’d love to see him rise to senior leadership,” Jewell added.</p>
<p>Looking up the ballot, Jewell characterized the presidential matchup as unprecedented.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote">
<blockquote>
<p>“This presidential election is very different because Trump is unique and she [Kamala Harris] arrived on the scene some 65 days ago,” he said. “Nobody alive today has ever experienced anything like this.”</p>
</blockquote>
</figure>
<p>In either outcome, Jewell said, the country will need “a lot of healing.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen partisanship so ugly.”</p>
<p>“Calling someone a liar has become so devalued. In the old, old days if you called someone a liar that might end up in a duel.”</p>

<p>Concerns over immigration and the economy led John Kindler, 65, to vote for Trump this evening.</p>
<p>“I want the country to be like it used to be,” he said. “I think our border security is weak and the economy is being neglected.”</p>
<p>Kindler also voiced support for fossil fuel extraction, which he said would receive a boost under Trump’s leadership and spur economic growth.</p>
<p>“When he was president we had strong overseas policy and our unemployment was low.”</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-small-font-size">

<p>Kindler said he’s not sold on Trump’s character, describing the former president as an “idiot,” though he believes “his policies are great.”&nbsp;</p>

</figure>
<p>Charles Miller, 57, said women’s rights were a deciding factor in his vote for Kamala Harris tonight.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty obvious that she would be the one to support,” Miller said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The right for women to determine their health care choices is important to Miller, who said under Trump the “opposite would happen,” referencing the overturning of Roe v. Wade by a Supreme Court flipped by Trump appointees.</p>

<p>Some years the vote count at the fire house is not much over 100, but this year, “we’re past over 500 votes. A lot of people are coming out to vote this election. Lots of 18-year-olds, lots of first-time voters.</p>

<p>Maddy and I are wrapping up our coverage, ending the day at Oakland Career Center where a once-lengthy line has dwindled down to a 15-minute wait.</p>
<p>Over the last hour, we caught up with several voters, all of whom were men who voted for Harris.</p>
<p>Andrew Jeannot, 20, was the first person today to mention that changes to DEI policies were a decisive factor in capturing his vote. As a Black man, he noted Trump’s increasing influence among his demographic and has found himself in debates about Trump’s leadership.</p>
<p>Sheridan McHenry, a member of the IBEW Local #5 Union, expressed similar concerns about Trump. McHenry said he voted for Harris because Trump is “against unions.”</p>
<p>We finished the day by talking with Erik Leonard, 21, who stuck to his “liberal family” roots in voting for Harris. While Leonard says he hasn’t paid attention to pre-election coverage, he will “keep an eye out” for the results, but there will be no election watch parties in his evening.</p>

<p>Editorial intern Amber Frantz and I have journeyed away from Pitt’s campus, where voting activity appeared to be dwindling. Now, we’re outside of the Oakland Career Center, a popular polling location for students who live off campus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, the line wraps around the building, and we’ve been told that the wait was up to an hour and a half in some cases. Arti and Morgan, 20-year-olds who declined to give their last names, said they observed no issues with the voting process here but had seen a few people come to the center to cast a ballot who were then redirected to other locations.&nbsp;</p>

(Photo by Amber Frantz/PublicSource)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Both women said they voted for Harris, with Arti mentioning Harris’ plan to back the middle class and being the daughter of immigrant parents as being some deciding factors for her. Morgan cited Harris’ stances on reproductive health, particularly access to IVF, and LGBTQ+ rights as securing her vote.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:20px">Venuri Siriwardane, Allegheny County elections warehouse, North Side, 2:38 p.m.</h5>
<p>Around 200 Allegheny County employees are in the final stages of pre-canvassing some 225,000 mail-in ballots.</p>
<p>Pre-canvassing is the process of preparing ballots before they’re officially returned. To make it easier to quickly tabulate results, workers check outer envelopes, verify signatures, remove ballots from inner, secrecy envelopes and inspect them for errors. (Canvassing, which follows, involves making sure that every valid ballot is counted.)</p>
<p>As of 2:20 p.m., all secrecy envelopes have been extracted from outer envelopes. Ballots were being scanned by 10 scanning machines here in the warehouse. County spokesperson Abby Gardner expected pre-canvassing to wrap up shortly, at which point most workers will be dismissed. Some workers will remain to process ballots that the U.S. Postal Service delivers to the warehouse by 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Two monitors mounted on a wall show the scanning and tabulation process. The lower leftmost feed shows the scanning process, while the feed next to it on the right shows the tabulation room.</p>
<p>This morning, according to Gardner and others, two Republican poll watchers attempted to observe the pre-canvassing using binoculars. The county stopped them from doing so, after which GOP attorneys in Courtroom 709 of the City-County Building negotiated with the county. The poll watchers may use binoculars, but not while ballots are being extracted from secrecy envelopes, and not in the area where votes are being scanned. Neither the dispute nor the agreement are believed to have reached the level of a formal court motion.</p>

<p>Election Fest is in full swing here with booths set up to snap photos, stain tie-dye shirts, play cornhole and grab as many stickers as humanly possible. Gen Z favorite artists Chappell Roan and Charli XCX have supplied background music for students passing through William Pitt Union Plaza.</p>
<p>Most of the students I’ve talked to say campus is generally lively today, but friends Anjola Oludayo and Maria Hernandez Castaneda said they felt it was unusually quiet. They chalked that up to classes being virtual, though. The friends said they felt surprisingly safe given the high stakes of the close-polling presidential race.</p>
<p>“While a lot of people don’t agree with everything [Harris] is for, she’s still allowing us to keep the right to disagree with her and not tell us to follow something,” Hernandez-Castaneda said.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote">
<blockquote>
<p>“She is democracy,” Oludayo added.</p>
</blockquote>
</figure>
<p>Democracy also came up with other students I talked to, like 21-year-old Angie Opoku, who said it felt “liberating” to vote as a Black woman on campus. Derek Haeussler, 20, said it felt “surreal” to cast a ballot in his first presidential election.</p>
<p>Climate change and abortion rights came in as top issues for many. For others, students’ rights, voter’s rights and the humanitarian crisis in Palestine, were front of mind as they cast their ballots.</p>

<p>One misleading claim was debunked earlier today by Allegheny County Councilman Sam DeMarco, the chairman of the county's Republican committee. <a href="https://twitter.com/sdemarcoii/status/1853805379093778764">He clarified</a> that a picture circulated on social media claiming to show Pennsylvania ballots pre-marked in favor of Harris did not resemble Pennsylvania ballots at all, and contained candidates that do not appear on the state’s ballots. "Don't buy into these false claims and please don't spread them," DeMarco wrote.</p>

<p>While the Pitt campus gears up for an Election Fest just outside of William Pitt Union at noon, I heard many students asking each other if they voted. Max Silver, 19, walked out of WPU proclaiming he’d just “voted for the G.O.A.T.” on a phone call. Who’s the greatest of all time? Harris, he said, but that’s not to say he agrees with all of her policies.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote">
<blockquote>
<p>Silver thinks Trump has a stronger plan for the southern border, but on “healthcare, interstate needs and the overall needs of people in the country,” Harris has him beat.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
</figure>
<p>Some students on Pitt’s campus weren’t nervous, including 21-year-old Anagha Venkatesh who said it was exciting to vote in a presidential election for the first time. As a person with Indian roots, sharing a cultural connection with Kamala Harris — who has both Indian and Jamaican roots — made it all the more special. As a kid, she said she never imagined it happening.</p>

<p>"I think over the past couple years there's been a dangerous precedent set with trying to suppress freedom of speech," she said outside her polling place at Montour High School.</p>
<p>She added that she was disturbed by the recent slaying of a police officer on a trail she uses often; local Republicans are blaming a progressive magistrate for releasing the suspect on non-monetary bond in 2023.</p>
<p>Another Robinson woman, 46-year-old April Hoffman, said she voted for Trump today because of the economy and border security. She said she has voted Republican the last couple elections but not always up and down the ballot.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:20px">Maddy Franklin, Soldiers &amp; Sailors Memorial Hall, Oakland, 10:50 a.m.</h5>
<p>I’m PublicSource’s higher ed reporter, and today I’m roaming the University of Pittsburgh campus, in Oakland.</p>
<p>Outside of Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall and Museum, 21-year-old Sophie Stefancic and 19-year-old Bree Francis had set up a station on behalf of the organization Feminist’s Majority. As a biology and pre-med major, Stefancic is concerned with securing reproductive rights, which compelled her to get involved in voter engagement efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.publicsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_1714-1.jpeg" alt="Three people stand by a table with &quot;Vote Blue&quot; signs and themed shirts." class="wp-image-1312245" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">University of Pittsburgh students Jocelyn Crowell, Sophie Stefancic and Bree Francis operate a table for the Feminist Majority Foundation outside Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall and Museum in Oakland on the morning of Nov. 5. (Photo by Maddy Franklin/PublicSource)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Francis feels this election is a decisive one for “the future of the country,” and for her, living in Pennsylvania has only heightened its importance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The women say they’ve been well-received on campus, which was evidenced by cars honking as they drove by their “Honk for Harris” sign.</p>
<p>“Every time they [honk], it’s like, OK, we’re not out here by ourselves. They are people behind us and that’s a really encouraging feeling, knowing that there’s other people out here that not just agree with us but are willing to honk in the middle of the busiest intersection in town and say ‘I agree with you, I’m with you, I’m here with you.’”</p>

First stop: U.S. Rep. <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/govpack_profiles/summer-lee/">Summer Lee</a> just cast her vote here. The District 12 Democrat faces a Republican opponent, <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/govpack_profiles/james-hayes/">James Hayes</a>, but the race has gotten little attention in a deeply blue district.</p>

There are around two dozen professionals in the courtroom, presumably including attorneys, and they’re huddled up talking about provisional ballots.

<h5 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:20px">I’m Charlie Wolfson, and I’ll be monitoring the voting process all day here at PublicSource. Allegheny County’s 1,327 polls opened at 7 a.m., and almost all of them opened on time and without incident. According to county spokesperson Abigail Gardner, two precincts were delayed.</h5>
<p>Whitehall’s 3rd precinct opened late because the judge of elections was late, but it was open as of 8:20 a.m. In Pittsburgh 31-03, a Lincoln Place precinct, the poll book was missing because the judge of elections was absent. As of 8:15 voters were able to cast provisional ballots, Gardner said, and the sheriff was in the process of delivering the poll book to restore normal operations.</p>
<p>In the county’s election warehouse, 200 county employees were sworn in at 7 a.m. to begin opening more than 215,000 mail-in ballots that have already been returned by voters. Throughout the day the ballots will be extracted, flattened and scanned, and the county expects to report mail-in ballot results around 8 p.m.</p>

<p>High-stakes choices await local voters up and down the ballot today, with the presidential contest far from the only big decision. (Follow PublicSource for up-to-the-minute results and race calls from the Associated Press.)</p>

<p>U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, a Scranton Democrat, is running for a fourth term in a close race with Republican Dave McCormick, a former hedge fund manager who lives in Pittsburgh. Democrats have just a one-seat majority in the Senate, and a tough national map means the party can’t afford to lose Casey’s seat if they hope to retain the upper chamber.</p>
<p>The U.S. House, meanwhile, is just as narrowly divided as the Senate and could also come down to Pennsylvania voters. The 17th District, the only competitive seat in the western part of the commonwealth, includes some Allegheny County suburbs and all of Beaver County. Incumbent Rep. Chris Deluzio, an Aspinwall Democrat, is trying to fend off Pine Republican state Rep. Rob Mercuri and win a second term. Deluzio won the district by 7 points in 2022.</p>

<p>Of a handful of “must win” districts to decide control of the state Senate, two are in Allegheny County.<a href="https://www.publicsource.org/pa-pennsylvania-senate-race-election-robinson-ruscitto-climate-environment-energy/"> The suburban 37th District, where Democrat Nicole Ruscitto challenges Republican Sen. Devlin Robinson</a>, is one of three that Democrats are trying to flip in order to take control. The Mon Valley-centric 45th District, which state Rep. Nick Pisciottano is trying to keep in Democratic hands against Republican Jen Dintini, is the Republicans’ best shot at a pickup.</p>
<p>The state House is even more narrowly divided, with Democrats holding an edge of 102 seats to 101. Allegheny County’s suburban 28th, 30th, 33rd and 44th districts will be key to the outcome in that chamber.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="vote-today">How to vote today</h2>
<p>Polls are open today from 7 a.m. until 8 p.m. Voters who get in line before 8 p.m. are eligible to vote even if they have to wait past 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Use this official website to <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/PollingPlaceInfo.aspx">find your polling place</a>. A handful of locations have changed since the last election.</p>
<p>Voters must already be registered to vote to participate in this election. The registration deadline was Oct. 21. <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/pages/voterregistrationstatus.aspx">Check your registration status here</a>.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="return-ballot">How to return a mail-in ballot</h2>
<p>More than 200,000 Allegheny County voters requested mail-in ballots for the General Election. Most have already returned them to the county, which stores them in a secure warehouse until Election Day morning, when they are opened and counted.</p>
<p>Any voter who still has a mail-in ballot should not put it in the mail. Ballots must be received by the county by 8 p.m. today, and having a postmark by that time does not qualify. Ballots placed in the mail today will not be counted.</p>
<div class="wp-block-group">
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" />
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide" />
 </div>
<p>To see if the county has received a mail-in ballot, <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/pages/ballottracking.aspx">use this state tracking website</a>.</p>
<p>A voter possessing a mail-in ballot today has options to make their vote count.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They can deliver it to the Allegheny County office building at 542 Forbes Ave., Downtown. (A voter can only deliver their own ballot this way.)</p>
<p>Voters can also turn in their mail-in ballot and pre-addressed envelope at their local polling place and vote there.</p>
<p>If a voter has lost their mail-in ballot or has reason to believe the county will not receive it on time, they can go to their local polling place and ask to vote via a provisional ballot. The county will set the provisional ballot aside and count it after verifying that the same voter did not return a mail-in ballot.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="voter-guides">What’s on my ballot?</h2>
<p>Pennsylvania ballots include contests ranging from president to state representative and, in some places, <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/wilkinsburg-home-rule-charter-general-election-ballot-question/">local referenda</a>. PublicSource created a guide to help Pittsburgh-region voters familiarize themselves with their choices for every race on the ballot this November.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="results-timing">When will we know who won?</h2>
<p>Pennsylvania counties report results at varying speeds. Allegheny County is expected to report all of its mail-in ballot results just after polls close at 8 p.m. Then results from the county’s 1,323 polling places are expected in batches between around 9 p.m. and midnight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow PublicSource’s live election results page, with up-to-the-minute data and race calls from the Associated Press.</p>

 </div>
<p>Other counties can take longer to report mail-in ballots. Philadelphia County officials have warned that it may not have complete results by day’s end.</p>
<p>While votes will almost certainly not be fully tabulated by the end of today, there is a possibility that media organizations such as the Associated Press will have enough data to declare winners tonight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the nationwide race for president, the timeline is murkier. The outcome could come down to states that are slower to count votes, like Arizona or Nevada.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-counted">How are votes counted?</h2>
<p>Where your ballot is scanned depends on how you cast it. Votes cast in person on Election Day are scanned at local voting precincts, and mail-in ballots are scanned at a central warehouse run by county employees.</p>
<p>The counting process begins at 7 a.m. on Election Day when county employees begin the process of opening and scanning more than 200,000 mail-in ballots at a county-run warehouse.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This warehouse has been under guard around the clock since ballots arrived, and a county official said there will be a large police presence inside and outside the building on Election Day.</p>
<p>Mail-in ballot envelopes are checked twice for a proper date and signature before being opened and then the ballots within are fed into high-speed scanners that can process 50,000 sheets per hour. The scanners load results onto two USB drives and the ballots themselves are kept as a backup.</p>
<p>Since the scanners are in the same building as the election night reporting network, the county is usually able to upload the results from these ballots almost immediately after polls close.</p>
<p>There are 1,327 voting precincts in Allegheny County, spread among 766 locations (some locations house multiple precincts). Each precinct has a ballot scanner, a machine to help people with disabilities mark ballots, and enough ballots for the voters who reside there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voters mark paper ballots with pens and feed the marked ballots into a scanner, which tallies the votes for each contest. The ballots are kept in a secure box inside the scanner to serve as a backup to the tally.</p>
<p>After polls close at 8 p.m., poll workers remove two USB drives from the scanner containing the results for that precinct and deliver them to Elections Division officials posted at one of eight drop-off sites. One drive is considered unofficial and is uploaded to the internet that night so the public can see the results quickly. The other, considered official, is loaded into the county’s closed network which never connects to the internet. The drives from the mail-in ballot scanners are handled the same way.</p>
<p>The ballot scanners also print strips of paper showing the results for the relevant precinct; one is posted outside the polling place and copies are also kept by poll workers and county officials.</p>
<p>In all, precinct results are recorded four different ways: The set of paper ballots, the two USB drives and the printouts.</p>
<p>As USB drives from precincts are delivered, results will be uploaded to the county website and news organizations like the Associated Press can begin to declare winners. PublicSource relies on Associated Press determinations to report election winners.</p>
<p>While it’s likely that all mail-in ballots and more than 90% of Election Day ballots in Allegheny County will be counted and reported by Wednesday morning, the counting and certification process will be far from finished.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Friday, the official Return Board will be sworn in, and it will verify that the number of people who signed into each precinct matches the number of votes at each. The board will also examine provisional ballots and determine which ones should be fully or partially counted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The county Board of Elections is tentatively scheduled to certify the election results on Nov. 25.</p>
