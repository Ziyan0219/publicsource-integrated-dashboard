Posted in Education Zombies to ‘Cabaret’: How Perry High’s arts scene is driving school spirit Perry High School was among the few PPS schools that showed a modest enrollment growth in 2024, despite various challenges. A year later, the school continues to push its boundaries to become a premier North Side school. by Lajja Mistry June 2, 2025 Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X Students run through a scene during drama club rehearsal after school at Perry Traditional Academy, Thursday, March 20, 2025, in Perry North. The drama club at the school continues to grow, with around 15 new students joining for the spring play. (Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/PublicSource) The drama club at Perry High relaunched last year with a wild idea: a zombie-apocalypse dinner murder mystery. Josey Cooley directed the show, acted in it and did hair, makeup and costumes. It marked the start of a creative revival that’s still growing a year later. The drama club is not only going strong, but has drawn a bigger, more enthusiastic crew for this year’s spring play. “This year we’ve got so many people — more people acting, so many more people backstage,” said Cooley, now a senior. “It’s brought, like, a lot more art into Perry this year, because a lot more people want to sew, a lot more people want to paint for the sets and do a bunch of stuff for it.” Aaron Taylor, top left, a music teacher, drama club instructor and marching band director at Perry Traditional Academy, stands with members of the band on March 20, in Perry North.

Click for info on the zine. And here’s all  of our North Side coverage . The expansion is part of the school’s continued emphasis, spearheaded by teacher Aaron Taylor, on expanding its arts program to make Perry a premier option on the North Side. And it’s happening at a time when Pittsburgh Public Schools overall is grappling with declining enrollment. While many schools face enrollment cliffs, Perry has seen modest growth and stability — a bright spot for the district. A safer, stable school community After gaining about 75 students last year, Perry’s enrollment held steady at around 430 students this school year. The school continues to partner with A+ Schools to boost attendance, offering incentives and tracking data to keep students engaged. Alongside Everyday Labs, the school has identified nearly 70 students on the verge of chronic absenteeism and is using strategies like buddy systems, phone calls, gift cards and cellphone passes to encourage better attendance.

Students and staff credit programs like Safe Passages for helping reduce disruptive behavior. This year, Perry also piloted an advisory program focused on self-efficacy, goal-setting and building strong relationships between students and staff. “[The advisory] gives another adult to check in on a child, have conversations with children that aren’t always instructional, just to make sure they’re doing what they need to do, and it’s also a voice so that their voice is heard,” said Principal Molly O’Malley-Argueta. She added that consistent leadership and improved staff attendance have helped foster a safer, more stable school environment. Challenges in education remain Senior Daz’jnae McFarland has worked diligently to earn the 1,250 hours required for a state cosmetology license through the school’s Career and Technical Education [CTE] program. Although she enjoys practicing the nail designing skills she learned in the CTE program, McFarland aspires to become a lawyer. She maintains a 4.0 GPA and is taking advanced classes as part of the University of Pittsburgh’s Justice Scholars Institute [JSI], where she is researching racial discrimination in the court justice systems.

(Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/PublicSource) English teacher Jason Boll said programs like JSI are part of the school’s effort to get more students interested in attending college. However, engaging students to follow those pathways remains a challenge. “We’re kind of built for reels and shorts right now, and so in order to understand a concept like chemistry, or in order to be an engineer, or in order to read a novel, you have to prolong, this is an act of prolonged attention, which is radical in today’s society,” he said. Test scores have shown mixed results on progress. One-third of Perry students scored proficient in 11th-grade reading in 2023, compared to 23% in 2022. But students scoring proficient in math went down from 15% to 7% during the same time. People leave Perry Traditional Academy at the end of the school day, Wednesday, April 17, 2024, in Perry North. Perry is Pittsburgh Public Schools’ only North Side high school. More than three-quarters of the neighborhood’s students have been drawn away to private schools, charters and specialized magnet programs in other parts of the city. (Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/PublicSource) O’Malley-Argueta said the school has provided consistent tutoring to students who need additional support in math, biology and English. “I think we’re in a pretty good place moving forward,” said Boll. “And I think you’re going to start to see more and more Perry kids not only attending college, but finishing college, and hopefully coming back to Pittsburgh.” Looking forward Despite challenges, spirits remain high at Perry. In the last year, the school’s band has grown and added a color guard. The band has performed at various events and venues including Acrisure Stadium, the St. Patrick’s Day parade, Cedar Point and the One Northside 10-year celebration.

Taylor said his goal is to create a strong foundational program that can last in the acting world. “These kids have something that is going to make the programs here that we’re trying to build last, and that’s pride,” he said. “They are proud to be a part of the acting community here. They’re proud to be a part of the band.” Lajja Mistry is the K-12 education reporter at PublicSource.
