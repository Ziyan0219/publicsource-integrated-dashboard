Posted in Trump Impacts Losing Medicaid would be a struggle for some, a disaster for others Readers told PublicSource their health, financial stability, employment or family’s wellbeing could be affected by Medicaid cuts passed in Washington, D.C. and awaiting implementation by states. by Charlie Wolfson July 15, 2025 September 24, 2025 Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X As massive Medicaid cuts — along with a tax cut extension and other fiscal changes — moved through Congress on their way to a July 4 signing by President Donald Trump, PublicSource asked readers about the role the public health insurance program plays in their lives, and their plans if they lose coverage. Here are some of the responses, edited for length and clarity. How do you rely on Medicaid? My daughter has an intellectual disability. She does have a job. She relies on Medicaid for her medical bills and prescriptions. Her job doesn’t offer any health insurance. I’m not sure how she, or we, would afford these bills for her. What would you do for health coverage if you lost Medicaid? I really don’t know. — Mary Ann, 70, Point Breeze How do you rely on Medicaid? I am a service coordinator working with unhoused people. Every single one of my clients relies on Medicaid for survival. I would also likely lose my job as there would be no source of funding for us. What would you do for health coverage if you lost Medicaid? I would lose my job at a hospital and lose my employer-sponsored health care. — Alex, 30, Strip District How do you rely on Medicaid? I am multiply disabled and can’t work, and in the very long and grueling process of trying to apply for disability. It is unclear to me if the current bill will have carve-outs for people who are collecting Supplemental Security Income or Social Security Disability Insurance, let alone those who only currently have a doctor’s note. The process for applying is long and hard, and for SSI requires you to keep less money than most Pittsburgh residents need just to pay bills in your account. Medicaid is pretty much the only way people doing this can get coverage if they are not a dependent. Medicaid is the only way I can afford medical care at all, including further investigating and treating the disabilities I have. What would you do for health coverage if you lost Medicaid? I may have to ask family to help pay for a public option plan, but I’m not sure if I could get one without having any income. I may just have to go without, which would be dangerous. I don’t know how I’d manage without medication. — Anonymous, 34, East End How do you rely on Medicaid? My son is on Medicaid after being diagnosed with Crohn’s disease. His medicine costs $14,000 a month, which is covered partially by my insurance and Medicaid. He also has regular blood tests and colonoscopy and endoscopy tests that would be very costly if not for Medicaid. This is a lifelong chronic autoimmune disorder. He can’t stop the medication or he would risk damage to his gut, and possible surgery or worse. What would you do for health coverage if you lost Medicaid? We would still have my health care coverage from my job but the out of pocket costs would be significant. I am a single mom of three. — Megan, 45, Brighton Heights How do you rely on Medicaid? My little brother is autistic and lives in a group home, attends a day program. If Medicaid funding is cut, then it could lead to a gradual churn of staff, reduced community outings, and possibly even force him to live with me as his 24/7 caregiver. What would you do for health coverage if you lost Medicaid? In a worst case scenario, my little brother would need to live with me. I took him in for 11 months during the pandemic and he really struggled with the loss of independence. — Anonymous, 34, Bethel Park How do you rely on Medicaid? I rely on Medicaid for my health care. I’m in a unique situation in that I work regularly roughly 20 hours a week, but I’m an athlete training for my last potential Olympiad. I don’t make enough money to afford health care on my own or out of pocket. But I rely on it in times of injury for physical therapy and regular blood work to monitor my health because my training is so demanding. Without Medicaid, I’d probably be forced to get health insurance or go without it, but being seen by my doctor or a physical therapist might still be out of the question. I know my medication out of pocket is roughly $500 for a 60-day supply, which when you only make $12,000 to $18,000 per year is a significant amount of money. I need to eat more than a normal person, training camps cost money. Food, housing, travel. Everything I earn goes to what I train for every day, and Medicaid allows me to breathe easy the few times I need it. Work requirements will probably cause me to lose my coverage because if I go to a race or training camp, I will lose eligibility immediately because I can’t work remotely. So I’ll be punished as a hard-working, taxpaying American trying to represent our country at the highest level. People would probably call me able bodied and I am, and I do work. It just so happens my job outside of my job is training my body full time. Some people would say grow up and work full time — sorry if I am not ready or willing to give up on my dreams. What would you do for health coverage if you lost Medicaid? I’d have to try to get insurance of some kind. But even still I probably won’t be able to afford to use it. My physical therapy for one month at two sessions per week for a back injury was several thousand dollars. Without Medicaid, I’d still probably have that injury which was severely impacting my performance and ability to train at the highest level possible. — Anonymous, 33, Lawrenceville How do you rely on Medicaid? I’m a trans woman, and I’ve been on hormone replacement therapy since I was 16. Medicaid is what’s made that possible. What would you do for health coverage if you lost Medicaid? I’d basically need to quickly get a job just to get insurance. I’ve already struggled to get any employment. — Connie, 19, West Mifflin Inside our Newsroom Pittsburgh’s Public Source interns discuss how to cope when news is ‘making you go crazy’ FIRST PERSON Practicing psychiatry left me suicidal.
