(Photo by Anastasia Busby/PublicSource) Experts and advocates want Allegheny County’s Juvenile Detention Advisory Board to bring transparency and accountability to a system long criticized for harming the youth it’s meant to rehabilitate. But it lacks enforcement power under state law — a limitation they sharply criticized in light of the county’s troubled history of youth incarceration. The county closed its youth detention center in 2021 after the state revoked its license due to multiple violations . A previous advisory board was in place when the violations occurred during former County Executive Rich Fitzgerald’s administration. Read about the new board tasked with advising the detention center New County Executive Sara Innamorato moved to re-establish the board nearly a year after the facility reopened as Highland Detention at Shuman , under private management by Adelphoi Western Region. Adelphoi — a group of nonprofits that faced lawsuits alleging negligence and abuse at its facilities — told PublicSource the county is pleased with its performance so far and pledged to work with the board on “enhancing advocacy for youth involved in the system.” Allegheny County’s Shuman Juvenile Detention Center in September 2023, in Lincoln-Lemington-Belmar. The county announced mid-September that it would hire private company Adelphoi to reopen and run the center, which was closed September 2021.

Innamorato appointed four and picked one from a pool of three finalists chosen by a council committee’s vote. The remaining three were appointed by the court’s president judge, Susan Evashavik DiLucente. Innamorato, or her designee, and County Controller Corey O’Connor, or his designee, will complete the 10-person board. Here’s what we found about their backgrounds and their plans for the work ahead, despite the board’s limited power.

(Photo courtesy of Kathi Elliott) Under her leadership, Gwen’s Girls launched the Black Girls Equity Alliance . The group’s four teams — including one focused on youth justice — work to address structural issues affecting the county’s Black girls. They’ve published several reports, including one by the University of Pittsburgh’s Sara Goodkind about the overrepresentation of Black girls in the county’s juvenile legal system. Elliott said she’ll bring to the board expertise the group developed during a decade of research. Most juvenile legal system institutions don’t meet the unique needs of girls, she added, noting that Shuman’s only operating pod houses boys. In Elliott’s previous role at the Center for Victims , she worked with the county’s Juvenile Court to expand services for victims of youth offenses. There, she noticed a cycle: If a young, traumatized victim didn’t get enough support, “they may show up a few months later as a defendant.” Inside our Newsroom Pittsburgh’s Public Source interns discuss how to cope when news is ‘making you go crazy’ FIRST PERSON Practicing psychiatry left me suicidal.

He got involved with gangs as a teen in Philadelphia and spent more than two decades in prison. He completed a master’s degree in social work after he was released in the 1990s and built his career around helping other formerly incarcerated people. He agreed with County Councilmember Bethany Hallam’s criticism of the board’s advisory nature. “I don’t want to be just an advisor,” he said. “We need teeth … and I’m going to do everything that I can to see what we can do to get some teeth.” Kristy Trautmann , executive director of FISA Foundation *, which awards grants to organizations improving the lives of women, girls and people with disabilities in the region Trautmann wrote in a statement that FISA’s work in recent years has focused on the school-to-prison pipeline, which “results in disproportionately large numbers of Black and brown children and children with disabilities being referred into the criminal justice system. “I believe we have a great responsibility to youth who are incarcerated, to make sure they are treated fairly and to ensure that we’re taking steps to address the root causes of the behaviors that led them here,” she added. “Oversight matters, and I believe this board will bring its collective expertise to the task.” Cheyenne Tyler , executive director of Café Momentum’s Pittsburgh location , part of a national workforce development nonprofit that offers paid internships in its restaurants and wraparound services to youth impacted by the juvenile legal system Tyler gave this reporter a tour of the group’s sleek Downtown restaurant, decorated in warm hues and featuring an open kitchen staffed by young people. She listed the resources it offers them, including academic tutoring, mental health support and access to a pantry stocked with essentials such as deodorant and period supplies. Cheyenne Tyler poses for a portrait in front of the Café Momentum mission statement on April 10, in Downtown. (Photo by Anastasia Busby/PublicSource) She started her career as a case manager at a youth correctional facility in South Florida, which she said was a transformative experience. “I saw that there were young people that had gifts that had no idea that they had gifts,” she said. They get caught up in systems “sometimes by no no wrongdoing of their own, just because of the color of their skin, their zip code, their family. And I saw that there was an injustice, and I became very passionate about it.” After moving back to her native Pittsburgh, Tyler became a supervisor in the Youth Support Partners program run by the county’s Department of Human Services, which offers peer support to young people in juvenile probation or other systems. She was also an administrator at Shuman for five years while it was operated by the county, including a role ensuring the facility complied with the Prison Rape Elimination Act . She spoke openly about the violations that occurred at Shuman, which she categorized as administrative and physical. While she believes “physical intervention” is necessary if young people are putting themselves or others at risk, she said violations happened more often during those situations. “When there was injustice or unfair treatment of young people … absolutely people should be held responsible or accountable for that.” Terri Collin Dilmore , an associate professor of psychology at Howard University and a clinical psychologist skilled in forensic evaluation of Black youth in the juvenile legal system Dilmore researches racial identity , multigenerational trauma in youth and interventions to meet their needs. Innamorato picked her among three finalists chosen by a County Council committee. She spent 15 years evaluating youth in the county and told the committee in March what she’s seen on the job. “The most egregious thing that’s been happening over the last four years is we have not had a juvenile detention facility,” she said, describing what she’s seen kids go through in the Allegheny County Jail.” She said she’s witnessed them “being cat-called” by adults, “being mishandled” by some workers and “not having the mental health resources that these youth really do need.” The jail didn’t step up its efforts to separate kids and adults until this year, she added. PublicSource reached out to Dilmore and the Howard media relations team. Neither responded to multiple interview requests. Jennifer S.

While attending law school in the 1990s, she was a teacher and counselor at the Whale’s Tale, which provided shelter and addiction treatment to unhoused youth in the East End. (It merged with another organization years later to become Familylinks .) She was chosen by Evashavik DiLucente. A spokesperson for the Fifth Judicial District of Pennsylvania didn’t respond to a request to interview both judges appointed to the board. Edward Mulvey , professor of psychiatry emeritus and former director of the law and psychiatry program at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine Mulvey researches violence and mental illness, services in the juvenile legal system, how clinicians judge the risk posed by youth and the appropriate treatment in those cases, among other interests detailed in his UPMC bio . He has also consulted for and written reports on mental health and juvenile legal policy for the U.S. Surgeon General’s Office, the National Institute of Mental Health and other federal agencies. He was picked by Evashavik DiLucente. Mulvey declined to comment. Tiffany E. Sizemore , a judge in the family division of the Court of Common Pleas Before joining the court, she was an associate professor of clinical legal studies at Duquesne University and directed its Youth Advocacy Clinic, which fought expulsions in school discipline cases. “Just one instance of exclusionary discipline increases a child’s chances of ending up in juvenile court,” she told Pittsburgh Lesbian Correspondents in 2021.

(Photo by Ryan Loew/PublicSource) She also said the county “utterly lacks diversity” on its bench. “If we want a court system that values all voices and does not reflexively affirm the voices of law enforcement, then we have to have people who understand that the police are an occupying force in many Black communities, as well as other marginalized communities, around this county and this country.” Sizemore was also the deputy director of the juvenile division in the county’s Office of the Public Defender, where she rewrote its practice standards to align with those recommended by a youth defense organization . And she was appointed to former Gov. Tom Wolf’s Juvenile Justice Taskforce , which assessed the state’s juvenile legal system and proposed reforms in a 2021 report . *The FISA Foundation has contributed funding to PublicSource.
