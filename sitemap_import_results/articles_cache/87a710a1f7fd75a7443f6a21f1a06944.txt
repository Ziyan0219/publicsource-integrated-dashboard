2020: The year in photos SIGN UP 2020: The year in photos By the PublicSource visuals team Dec. 28, 2020 A global pandemic shut down many aspects of our lives. Demonstrations calling for racial justice filled our streets. A contentious election consumed our attention. This past year has proven to be a nearly nonstop drumbeat of news. Throughout 2020, PublicSource’s visual team and local freelancers have documented this historic year from our corner of the world in Pittsburgh. While big — often breaking — news stories have dominated much of this year, we’ve also directed our cameras toward critical and often overlooked issues such as environmental health, tenants’ rights and the accessibility of our city for people with disabilities. Below are several of our favorite photos from 2020. On Aug. 17, 2019, residents of the De Ruad Street apartments in West Oakland watched their homes go up in flames. PublicSource checked in with four of the 20 De Ruad Street households over the six months following the fire. Some residents described the assistance they received as slow in coming and not enough to make up for all that they lost. That meant their lives were in limbo for weeks or months. Here, former De Ruad Street resident Devin McClain is photographed outside his former apartment building in January.
