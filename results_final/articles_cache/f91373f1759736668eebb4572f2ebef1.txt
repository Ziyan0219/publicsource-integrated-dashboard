Monica Ruiz, the executive director of Casa San Jose, which provides support services to more than 6,000 in the local Latino community annually, said many local businesses are struggling because employees are afraid to go to work for fear of being detained by federal immigration enforcement. “I think it’s important to understand that what’s happening now politically is scaring people,” Ruiz said. “People are afraid to go to work whether they have status or not. … People are afraid to be walking around, going to work because of the color of their skin.” The business closures were part of a nationwide “Day Without Immigrants” protest, with people refraining from work and making purchases in numerous cities . “If businesses want to turn away customers for a day to protest criminal illegal immigrants being deported and our immigration laws being enforced, so be it,” wrote Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, in response to a request for comment from PublicSource. “The Trump administration will continue to prioritize the well being and safety of American citizens above all else.” Ruiz referenced the ramp-up in Immigration and Customs Enforcement [ICE] activity since President Donald Trump was inaugurated Jan. 20, a follow-through on the president’s campaign promise to conduct a “mass deportation” of undocumented immigrants. Ruiz could not say how many people have been detained by ICE in Pittsburgh, though she said enforcement so far has been targeted against individuals, not sweeping raids at workplaces.

But just imagine the inconvenience if that restaurant and many others didn’t exist. … Even though these people are going to lose money today because they’re not open, that’s nothing compared to what can happen for the years to come if things continue to be the way they’re going right now.” Guillermo Velazquez, executive director of a small-business incubator serving immigrants, said his organization Pittsburgh Hispanic Development Corporation helped launch 33 businesses last year, which have combined for $10 million in sales.
