(Photo by Anastasia Busby/PublicSource) Stress is part of life, but with a looming election, growing geopolitical tensions and the onslaught of online information at our fingertips, daily stressors can quickly become overwhelming. Research shows that too much stress can have negative physiological effects, but mindfulness interventions to decrease stress and boost well-being have the potential to improve health. The stressors that come with being a college student inspired Emily Lindsay to start incorporating yoga and meditation into her life. Now an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Pittsburgh, Lindsay studies how psychological and biological pathways relate to stress. “Mindfulness interventions, particularly those that focus on acceptance skills — welcoming your experience, having a non-reactive, non-judgmental, open and receptive attitude towards the present moment — [can] reduce biological stress reactivity,” Lindsay said. Taking the time to prioritize a mindful practice takes dedication, Lindsay said, but finding an outlet to cope with physical and mental stress can be beneficial in the long run. PublicSource spoke with community members and compiled a list of low- to no-cost activities and resources around the region to help alleviate stress and boost well-being. Cat lounges and cat cafes A great way to get your mind off the news is to enjoy time with furry creatures that couldn’t care less about it. Research shows a connection between petting animals and reductions in levels of cortisol, a hormone that causes feelings of stress, and many pet owners have reported that being with their animal positively impacts their mental health by providing a calming presence.

Most cat cafes and lounges allow visitors to adopt cats they fall in love with, a practice Ciotoli described as a “symbiotic relationship where everyone wins.” “[We’re] helping cats find their forever home and helping people find their new best friends,” she said.

Swissvale Ave., Edgewood Hours: Fri-Sun 3-8 p.m. After a long week, Rescue and Relax provides the perfect place for people of all ages to mingle with a cast of around 15 cats.

Strumming and stretching The Pittsburgh Banjo Club performs on Oct. 23, at the Elks Lodge, in East Allegheny. The band mostly plays music from the 1920s.

(Photo by Anastasia Busby/PublicSource) Engaging the senses and the body are two surefire ways to ease the mind. If you’re looking for a fun night with free entertainment, look no further than the Pittsburgh Banjo Club’s weekly practice. For the past 19 years, the club has held public rehearsals every Wednesday night at the Allegheny County Elks Lodge #339. Around a dozen banjoists perform music from across the 19th and 20th centuries, from bluegrass to the Beatles. Pittsburgh Banjo Club Cost: Free admission, food and drinks available for purchase Address: 400 Cedar Ave., East Allegheny Hours: Wed 7-11 p.m. The club plays from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. with a half-hour break. The kitchen and bar are open if you’re looking for a low-cost meal. Norman Azinger, who has played in the club since its founding in 1988, encouraged anyone to visit and listen to “this great banjo music that we play.” Norman Azinger plays his banjo on Oct. 23, at the Elks Lodge, in East Allegheny. The Pittsburgh Banjo Club is going on 37 years. (Photo by Anastasia Busby/PublicSource) “We have a lot of young people come, a lot of gray-haired people come, it’s such a mixed crowd,” Azinger said. “Sometimes they’re playing cards or parcheesi, but in the background there’s always good music for them to listen to.” He added that banjo nights are a politics-free zone and are meant to foster a fun and relaxed atmosphere. “Come on down. If you don’t like banjos you can leave,” Azinger joked. Yoga, a 3,000-year-old practice, has proven therapeutic effects in reducing stress and anxiety by connecting the mind and body. However, cost barriers associated with yoga can often make routine participation difficult. Big Free Yoga [BFY] classes are open to all ages and skill levels. Participants are encouraged to bring their own mat and a friend. Advanced registration is available online , and all participants must have a waiver on file with ASCEND Climbing Gym .

BONUS: stay and climb for only $15 (rental shoes are included) Address: Velum Fermentation, 2120 Jane St., South Side Flats Hours: Meets monthly for one hour on the weekends To help make the practice more affordable and accessible for all, ASCEND has partnered with Velum Fermentation . ASCEND has two locations in Pittsburgh, but October’s BFY class took place at Velum Fermentation, adjacent to ASCEND South Side. Taylor Solomon, a yoga instructor at ASCEND, was introduced to yoga as a way to reduce physical stress after an ankle break in college. Turns out, it helped with her mental stress as well. “It [yoga] was huge for my mental health in grad school. I was able to focus more because I knew I have this thing where I get to go after my classes and take care of myself,” Solomon said.

(Photo by Anastasia Busby/PublicSource) Solomon leads restorative and BFY classes at ASCEND in addition to her full-time job as a therapist. Before she begins a class, Solomon’s favorite thing to do is “read the room,” a tactic she uses to tailor her instruction to the needs of her students. “If I see someone with an injury or someone comes up to me and says, ‘Hey, my knees aren’t feeling really good’ or ‘I just had surgery a few weeks ago, but I really want to do this,’ I slow my pace down, and I think people really appreciate that,” Solomon said. “I really love encouraging a slow, powerful class that encourages that restorative [practice] at the end.” Libraries: Books, but also activities Pittsburgh is home to a plethora of public libraries which serve as peaceful spaces to relax and unwind. Libraries not only provide access to literature and media offerings, they provide resume and career development resources and free access to the internet and printing services. Many libraries offer educational programming, including opportunities for children and teens. Library cards are free to residents of Allegheny County, and all Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh [CLP] locations are fine free.

<p>Engaging the senses and the body are two surefire ways to ease the mind.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a fun night with free entertainment, look no further than the Pittsburgh Banjo Club’s weekly practice. For the past 19 years, the club has held public rehearsals every Wednesday night at the Allegheny County Elks Lodge #339. Around a dozen banjoists perform music from across the 19th and 20th centuries, from bluegrass to the Beatles.</p>
<p><strong>Pittsburgh Banjo Club</strong><br /><strong>Cost: </strong>Free admission, food and drinks available for purchase<br /><strong>Address: </strong>400 Cedar Ave., East Allegheny<br /><strong>Hours: </strong>Wed 7-11 p.m.</p>
<p>The club plays from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. with a half-hour break. The kitchen and bar are open if you’re looking for a low-cost meal.</p>
<p>Norman Azinger, who has played in the club since its founding in 1988, encouraged anyone to visit and listen to “this great banjo music that we play.”</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.publicsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/10242024_banjonight_AB_0428.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1311805" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Norman Azinger plays his banjo on Oct. 23, at the Elks Lodge, in East Allegheny.

<p>“We have a lot of young people come, a lot of gray-haired people come, it's such a mixed crowd,” Azinger said. “Sometimes they’re playing cards or parcheesi, but in the background there’s always good music for them to listen to.”</p>
<p>He added that banjo nights are a politics-free zone and are meant to foster a fun and relaxed atmosphere.</p>
<p>“Come on down. If you don’t like banjos you can leave,” Azinger joked.</p>
<p>Yoga, a 3,000-year-old practice, has proven <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3193654/">therapeutic effects</a> in reducing stress and anxiety by connecting the mind and body. However, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5786160/#:~:text=The%20perceived%20high%20costs%20associated,well%20as%20racial%2Fethnic%20minorities.">cost barriers</a> associated with yoga can often make routine participation difficult.</p>
<p>Big Free Yoga [BFY] classes are open to all ages and skill levels. Participants are encouraged to bring their own mat and a friend.

<p><strong>ASCEND Climbing Gym Big Free Yoga</strong><br /><strong>Cost: </strong>Admission is free. BONUS: stay and climb for only $15 (rental shoes are included)<br /><strong>Address:</strong> Velum Fermentation, 2120 Jane St., South Side Flats<br /><strong>Hours: </strong>Meets monthly for one hour on the weekends</p>
<p>To help make the practice more affordable and accessible for all, ASCEND has partnered with <a href="https://www.velumfermentation.com/">Velum Fermentation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASCEND has two locations in Pittsburgh, but October’s BFY class took place at Velum Fermentation, adjacent to ASCEND South Side.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taylor Solomon, a yoga instructor at ASCEND, was introduced to yoga as a way to reduce physical stress after an ankle break in college. Turns out, it helped with her mental stress as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It [yoga] was huge for my mental health in grad school. I was able to focus more because I knew I have this thing where I get to go after my classes and take care of myself,” Solomon said.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.publicsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/10272024_Ascendyoga_AB_0173.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1311803" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Taylor Solomon instructs ASCEND’s free yoga event on Oct. 27, at Velum Fermentation in South Side.

<p>Solomon leads restorative and BFY classes at ASCEND in addition to her full-time job as a therapist. Before she begins a class, Solomon’s favorite thing to do is “read the room,” a tactic she uses to tailor her instruction to the needs of her students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“If I see someone with an injury or someone comes up to me and says, ‘Hey, my knees aren’t feeling really good’ or ‘I just had surgery a few weeks ago, but I really want to do this,’ I slow my pace down, and I think people really appreciate that,” Solomon said. “I really love encouraging a slow, powerful class that encourages that restorative [practice] at the end.”</p>
