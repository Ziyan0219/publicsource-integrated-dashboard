(Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/PublicSource) Mayor Ed Gainey thought he had a deal with UPMC early last year that would have made good on a major campaign promise and brought a much-needed flow of cash into Pittsburgh’s coffers. He said he left a Feb. 14, 2024 meeting with senior UPMC officials thinking the healthcare giant had just committed to paying the city $12.5 million annually for 10 years — an unprecedented commitment from UPMC, which is the city’s largest owner of tax-exempt property. But the deal quickly fell apart, Gainey said, when a new wrinkle was added: The sum was to be split by the city and Allegheny County. Gainey balked because county officials had not been involved in the talks up to that point. “It is not my job to negotiate on behalf of the county,” Gainey said in an interview. “I thought the deal was for the city. County Executive Sara Innamorato is perfectly competent to be able to negotiate her own deal. There’s no way that I was going to take a deal and she had never been at the table. That would be wrong … and that’s not the deal that we had earlier that day.” Contradicting Gainey, UPMC spokesperson Paul Wood said in an email Wednesday that “There has never been a deal on the table. … There have been lots of ‘asks’ but there has never been a deal.” Wood reiterated a longstanding UPMC position that it would participate in programs that include the region’s other major nonprofits. Gainey described the negotiations, which have not been reported previously, during an interview with PublicSource Wednesday. A spokesperson for County Executive Sara Innamorato said that while Innamorato was not involved in any of the talks Gainey described, the account Gainey shared Wednesday broadly matches her understanding of what happened.

Local Government Pittsburgh leaders have long failed to attract payments from nonprofits. How did a smaller city lock in $220 million? Providence inked a landmark, 20-year agreement with universities for voluntary payments. Pittsburgh gets hardly anything from its tax-exempt institutions, with no deal in sight. His predecessor, Bill Peduto, sought a grand bargain with multiple nonprofits and fell short of that mark, but left office tallying a variety of projects and contributions backed by large tax-exempt entities. In the early 2000s, Mayor Tom Murphy engineered the multi-year Pittsburgh Public Service Fund, in which more than 100 nonprofit entities made contributions totaling around $5 million a year. Gainey said the funds contemplated in his negotiation with UPMC would have been controlled by a five-member board, with four members appointed by Gainey and one member appointed by UPMC CEO Leslie Davis. “I had no problem with that, I agreed to that deal,” Gainey said. The episode, per Gainey’s description, was the closest the mayor has come to fulfilling one of the main promises from his 2021 campaign — to make major nonprofits such as UPMC “pay their fair share” to fund city services.
