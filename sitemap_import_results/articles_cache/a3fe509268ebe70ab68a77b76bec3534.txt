Posted in PUBLIC SAFETY Pittsburgh’s police review board head says Gainey administration ‘has not been transparent’ Contemplating a probe into a rough June arrest, the Citizen Police Review Board says the administration has closed its windows into police camera footage. by Charlie Wolfson July 23, 2025 September 30, 2025 Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X Pittsburgh police in Oakland during protests ahead of President Donald Trump's visit July 15. (Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/Pittsburgh's Public Source) The head of the watchdog agency that investigates Pittsburgh’s police said Tuesday that Mayor Ed Gainey’s administration has lacked transparency when it comes to law enforcement. “This administration has not been transparent, they have not been cooperative, they have not assisted this board in fulfilling your chartered mission, your mandate from the people,” said Beth Pittinger,  executive director of the independent Citizen Police Review Board [CPRB], during a public meeting of the board’s members. “They have said that they are cooperative, they have said that they are transparent. They are not.” The statement came as the board prepares to launch a formal investigation into a forceful June 10 arrest in the North Side, during which several officers pulled a disabled Black man out of a car , pinned him to the ground and carried him across the street. Pittinger said during the board’s June meeting that the city had yet to provide the board with information sought about the arrest to determine whether to investigate. Ahead of Tuesday’s meeting, Pittinger told Public Source in an email that there was still no response and that she would recommend the board open an investigation “to allow staff time to issue a subpoena and go from there.” Olga George, the mayor’s press secretary, responded to Pittinger’s claims late Wednesday, saying that the city is transparent with the CPRB and the statements “mischaracterized the city’s commitment to accountability.” “If these requests are being sent to individuals who have not responded or failed to elevate the matter, we ask that she approach administration leadership directly to escalate her requests rather than routing them through the media …” George said. “Transparency is a shared responsibility, and communication must be directed appropriately to be effective.” Department of Public Safety spokesperson Cara Cruz said in an email to Public Source Wednesday afternoon that neither the department nor the acting chief of police are aware of any requests for evidence from the CPRB, with which they communicate “regularly.” Pittinger disputed Cruz’s statement, reading from emails between the CPRB investigator and an administrative assistant to a police higher-up. She said the investigator requested documents and video pertaining to the arrest on June 12, and just a day later, the assistant responded, saying “Confirmed. I will add it to the log.” Gainey ran for office in 2021 in part on a platform of police accountability and transparency. His campaign website at the time included a pledge to strengthen the CPRB and give it more power to compel testimony from officers and “conduct thorough, independent investigations of police misconduct.” Content warning: This story and video includes a violent arrest and language some may find objectionable.
