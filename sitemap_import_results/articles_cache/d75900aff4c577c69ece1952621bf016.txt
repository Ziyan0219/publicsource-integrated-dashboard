Posted in FIRST PERSON They said ‘be a secretary,’ but instead I’m the official artist of the Garbage Olympics My grandfather’s habit of turning other people’s trash into art has echoed through my life. Now I’m creating art for Pittsburgh’s biggest trash clean-up event. by First-person essay by Maria DeSimone Prascak September 12, 2025 September 24, 2025 Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X Maria DeSimone Prascak paints the outside of Johno’s Art Studio, on the South Side Slopes, on Friday Sept. 5, 2025.

(Photo by Alex Jurkuta/Pittsburgh’s Public Source) I’m Maria DeSimone Prascak, a lifelong Pittsburgh resident, proud business owner, and the official artist of the 2025 Pittsburgh Garbage Olympics — a title that may sound unusual, but one I embrace wholeheartedly. It represents a cause I’m deeply passionate about: keeping our neighborhoods clean and inspiring others through art to care about our environment. I grew up in the Arlington neighborhood, in a close-knit, compassionate and creative family. From a young age, I was taught to be kind to neighbors, take pride in my home and never litter. My siblings and I were encouraged to be creative with what we had, often making things from found objects. It was fun, challenging and in tune with the resourceful values passed down from my grandparents who immigrated to Pittsburgh and lived through the Great Depression.

(Photo by Alex Jurkuta/Pittsburgh’s Public Source) My grandfather was known in the neighborhood for crafting furniture, dollhouses, lamps, picture frames and more from salvaged materials — sometimes even neighbors’ discarded trash. His creativity and frugality, once seen as eccentric, are now celebrated. I still proudly display Grandpa’s pieces he created at age 77 — the scarlet macaw painted on scrap wall paneling with a handmade frame, a stone house lamp and a piano music box made using repurposed materials — in my home just a few blocks from where I grew up. Art made by Maria DeSimone Prascak’s grandfather. (Photo by Alex Jurkuta/Pittsburgh’s Public Source) Inspired by generations of artists in my family, I always knew I would become a professional artist. I excelled in art throughout high school and was determined to start my own business after graduation. When I told my school counselor that I didn’t plan to attend college and wanted to pursue art full-time, he dismissed the idea, saying, “You’ll never make it, you have long fingers, learn to type and be a secretary.” I see no problem with someone being a secretary, but that wasn’t my passion. Him telling me I would fail only motivated me more. I am currently celebrating 43 years in business as a full-time professional artist. My journey from defiant high school senior to the hallowed position of Garbage Olympics artist, though, didn’t come without self-discovery, pain and adaptation. How losing focus became a super power As a young adult, I often struggled to understand why I couldn’t focus on my art projects until the very last minute, or why I’d lose interest midway through and want to jump into something new before finishing what I started. Once I realized how my brain was wired, everything began to make sense. Although I’ve never been officially diagnosed, those close to me can see that I check nearly every box associated with ADD and ADHD. I learned to work with my ADHD, not against it, seeing it as a powerful tool for success in life and in pursuing dreams — and that shift changed everything.

(Photo by Alex Jurkuta/Pittsburgh’s Public Source) I wouldn’t have achieved what I have, especially in the ever-changing world of running an art business, without this wonderfully unique way of thinking. In fact, there are times I feel sorry for those who don’t think this way. ADD and ADHD fuel my creativity and help me show up fully as an artist every single day, while allowing me to feel at ease with change and experimentation. Trying new things is essential for me, since I tend to lose interest in anything that becomes too repetitive or time-consuming. As a result, I’m rarely at a loss for creative inspiration — whether I’m working on a painting or a mixed media project. Over time, I’ve also learned to harness my hyperfocus, especially when deadlines are approaching. It’s become a powerful tool, helping me dive deep into my work and consistently meet every deadline without fail.

The truth is, we all think, work, and create differently — and that is something worth celebrating. I do my best to tell others, especially parents, that ADHD should be understood and embraced. Proving anyone can paint I launched Maria’s Ideas in 1982 in a studio perched at the top of the South Side Slopes and have been a full-time working artist ever since. From handmade greeting cards and Pittsburgh-themed jackets (including one worn by Mayor Sophie Masloff in a St. Patrick’s Day parade), to airbrushed t-shirts and signs, I built a loyal customer base.

(Photo by Alex Jurkuta/Pittsburgh’s Public Source) After years of airbrushing, sometimes up to 16 hours a day, I developed chronic tendonitis in my dominant hand. Faced with the possibility of surgery and permanent damage, I chose a different path: rest, therapy and a return to painting, especially murals. Since 1993, I have painted thousands of murals in homes and businesses throughout the region. Highlights include a 450-foot mural installation with ceiling domes and jeweled animals at Sarris Candies in Canonsburg, as well as custom murals for the Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium. One of the most meaningful projects of my career was creating more than 15 murals for the trauma unit at UPMC Western Psychiatric Hospital’s Zoe Atrium. These nature-inspired murals, paired with uplifting quotes from the staff, now brighten patient rooms, hallways, entryways, common areas, the nurses’ station, activity atrium and staff kitchen — transforming the environment into one of healing and hope. Paint brushes with inspiring messages written on them hang from a repurposed wall hook in Johno’s Art Studio on Sept. 5. (Photo by Alex Jurkuta/Pittsburgh’s Public Source) After scaling back during the COVID-19 pandemic, and saying no to many artistic requests, I shifted focus to custom wall art, pet and house portraits, and sculpture made from found and vintage materials, many of which were destined for the landfill. I have sold hundreds of these one-of-a-kind pieces. I’m always on the lookout for discarded treasures during my regular litter cleanups. Googley eyes recently found on the curb are among my favorite finds to date. I will someday find a way to incorporate them into a fun work of art. Art has the power to heal and build self-confidence. Art has helped me get through some hard times throughout my life, serving as a powerful tool in navigating both physical challenges and emotionally difficult periods. I enter a meditative state, where I find calm and clarity, soothing sadness and easing anxiety during periods of deep loss and trauma. Teaching and inspiring others, and “giving back” have become a fulfilling part of my journey. In 2015 I began volunteering at Little Sisters of the Poor, and I now teach regularly at the National Aviary, designing and leading art classes since 2017. Since 2023 I’ve been producing and hosting an award winning volunteer cable TV show “Maria’s Ideas Teaches Us To Paint” with my co-host Al Levine, for Bethel Park Public Access Television, inspiring others to try painting while teaching some basics. I’ve done personalized painting events for the Steelers, Penguins and corporations including PPG Paints. I especially love encouraging those who say, “I can’t paint,” because I always prove them wrong, often in just one session. What’s the Garbage Olympics? Efforts to foster connection, creativity and community pride have led to work with community groups, and that landed me in Pittsburgh City Council’s chambers on a fateful February day. I was incredibly honored when Councilor Bob Charland and the rest of council issued an official proclamation naming Feb. 25 “Maria’s Ideas Day” in recognition of my positive social impact through art. While there, I met Alicia Carberry, initiatives manager for Charland’s office representing District 3, and shared that I regularly pick up litter in my neighborhood. We instantly connected over our shared passion for the environment, and the idea for something bigger was born. An art piece entitled “Pittsburgh Measures up” is displayed in Johno’s Art Studio on Sept. 5. (Photo by Alex Jurkuta/Pittsburgh’s Public Source) Alicia mentioned the Garbage Olympics , an annual event in Pittsburgh since 2017. I’d heard of it, but usually just through Facebook posts that I noticed too late. It turns out the annual cross-neighborhood clean-up competition has dozens of contestant groups — 48 this year — often drawing more than 550 volunteers citywide who spend a morning assembling something like 1,000 bags of trash plus tires, TVs, mattresses and rusty appliances. Together with Alicia, city Sustainable Procurement Specialist Omoye Aikhuele and my husband and fellow artist Johno Prascak, we launched an initiative for the 2025 Garbage Olympics, inviting residents from Pittsburgh’s 90 neighborhoods to create artwork inspired by their communities. I designed free art kits for people of all ages, and the submitted pieces will be showcased at the closing ceremony on Sept. 13. Selected works will also be displayed at PRT bus stops throughout the city. I even created a whimsical logo featuring a “trash panda” artist popping out of a garbage can. Maybe that panda can awaken in others the spirit my grandfather inspired in me. I often ask, “Why is it so difficult to get residents — whether homeowners or renters — to simply keep their property clean and free of litter?” If everyone took responsibility for their own space, the impact on our communities would be tremendous. Adding a new element to the Garbage Olympics has given me renewed hope. I believe that if we can channel our energy into creativity and community, we’ll inspire the next generation to care more deeply for Mother Earth, and to work toward communities that are both vibrant with art and free of litter.
