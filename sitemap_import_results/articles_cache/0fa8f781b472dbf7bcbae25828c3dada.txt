[PBS Screenshot] Credit: PBS Screenshot Hours before Joseph R. Biden would be sworn in as America’s 46th president on Wednesday, thousands of flags swayed and fluttered in darkness on the National Mall. The flags dot the grounds in place of Americans who were unable to travel to Washington, D.C., for the inauguration due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and increased security threats. It was an unusual start to mark a momentous shift in American leadership. Safety concerns have heightened in the days since pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 while lawmakers certified Biden’s win in the November 2020 election. To boost security during the inauguration, 25,000 National Guard troops were deployed.

[11:40 a.m.] The 59th presidential inauguration opened with a brief speech by Sen. Amy Klobuchar who marked the day as a celebration: “We pledge today to never take our democracy for granted as we celebrate its remarkable strength. We celebrate its resilience, its grit,” she said. The swearing-in ceremony is scheduled to begin at noon. The hours leading up were quieter than usual, without masses of crowds piling together to get peeks of the new president. A few hours prior, President Donald Trump gave a brief speech at Joint Base Andrews before leaving on his final Air Force One flight as president to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida residence. In Trump’s remarks, he thanked his supporters and, while he didn’t mention President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris by name, he wished the new administration “great luck and great success.” “I think they’ll have great success,” he continued. “They have the foundation to do something really spectacular.” He concluded his remarks saying, “Have a good life. We will see you soon.” “Have a good life,” President Trump said to a small crowd of his supporters at Joint Base Andrews before boarding Air Force One for the final time, as “YMCA” by the Village People played over the speakers. He vowed that “we will be back in some form.” https://t.co/afGfULL33l pic.twitter.com/NDx0lMO1D0 — The New York Times (@nytimes) January 20, 2021 Inside our Newsroom Pittsburgh’s Public Source interns discuss how to cope when news is ‘making you go crazy’ FIRST PERSON Practicing psychiatry left me suicidal.

In each of these moments, enough of us have come together to carry all of us forward. And we can do that now. History, faith and reason show the way of unity. We can see each other, not as adversaries but as neighbors.” Biden took a moment of silence during his speech, an acknowledgment of the 400,000 Americans who have died nearly one full year into the pandemic. At the close of Biden’s remarks, Singer Garth Brooks performed Amazing Grace, asking the crowd – both in D.C. and at home – to join in the stretch of chorus. Local, state leaders weigh in Though many couldn’t travel and attend the inauguration in person, local politicians have congregated on social media to congratulate and comment on Biden, Harris and Wednesday’s events.
