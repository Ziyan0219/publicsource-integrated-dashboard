Posted in Public-service guides Hey, students: Here’s how to get off campus, enjoy Pittsburgh Navigating a new city can be hard for college students, but there are organizations and programs available that connect scholars to Pittsburgh. by Briana Bindus August 27, 2024 Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X With 29 colleges and universities in and around Pittsburgh, students enrolled in higher education regionally total around 145,000 — the equivalent of nearly half of the population within the city limits. Students come from across the country and globe and settle into a new life around their campus. There’s nothing that limits students to campus, but leaving that comfortable environment can be difficult. There are plenty of resources available to help students go beyond the gates of academia and get to know surrounding neighborhoods. Exploring the city One of the first places a newcomer can look for things to do around the city is VisitPITTSBURGH , a nonprofit organization that seeks to connect people to the region through food, culture and events. VisitPITTSBURGH prioritizes the student population through its BURGH101 initiative. A free passport provides discounts at more than 60 places across the city, including local and chain restaurants, hotels and even Steelers games. Similarly, the Allegheny County Library Association invites students to sign up for a free library card, providing access to all 70 library branches across the county, including the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh . Cardholders who are 18 or older get access to a free RAD Pass , sponsored by the Allegheny Regional Asset District . This pass connects students to Pittsburgh’s cultural life through free or discounted museum, zoo, symphony and aviary tickets, and provides access to RAD-specific events.

(Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/PublicSource) The RAD Pass comes in handy for students who have limited disposable income, according to James Santelli, communications manager for the Allegheny Regional Asset District. “They still have the same cultural opportunities that everybody else does,” he said. “As a city, we tout ourselves as punching above our weight class in terms of arts, culture, museums and opportunities,” Santelli said, “and I think that’s true. Students can only appreciate that if they see it for themselves. … They can see what Pittsburgh has to offer and why it’s so important that we invest in these places.” The Pittsburgh Cultural District also offers student discounts to its full slate of theatrical shows and performances, festivals and workshops. Students looking to get into nature are in luck, with over 176 parks to choose from across within the city alone, and free events offered by the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy . Getting around the city There are a number of transportation options available for students.

Students, faculty and staff at the University of Pittsburgh get unlimited 30-minute rides on these bikes. While other universities don’t have the same partnership with POGOH, the bike-share program is placing stations near other campuses, according to Erin Potts, director of marketing and outreach for POGOH. “Creating stations that are going to connect you from campus to other locations around Pittsburgh is a big priority for us,” Potts said, which is why POGOH is going to expand the number of stations across Pittsburgh in 2025. For now, there are a number of membership options for students, including a $120 annual pass, a $25 flex pass with 200 minutes of ride time, or a $10 mobility justice membership for those who receive government assistance, including SNAP, LIHEAP and Medicare or Medicaid. POGOH’s partnership with Pitt has really taken off, according to Potts, and the program’s most popular stations are in and around Oakland. Potts said POGOH hopes to expand its student access program to include more universities across Pittsburgh. “Let’s create a city where the expectation is that you don’t have to have access to a personal car in order to enjoy our city, to get around in our city, and access all of the different kinds of resources that those students will need throughout their time here in Pittsburgh,” Potts said.

Carnegie Mellon, Carlow, Chatham, Point Park and University of Pittsburgh students get access to public transportation fare-free. Duquesne University students get reduced fares through the U-Pass program . Inside our Newsroom Pittsburgh’s Public Source interns discuss how to cope when news is ‘making you go crazy’ The independent, nonprofit newsroom shares journalistic skills with its interns, but also relies on their fresh eyes for insights and inspiration. Help in the city For emerging college students, it isn’t just about exploring the city, but studying and navigating new realms alone — which can be daunting. There are resources across college campuses and within the city to help with getting nutritious food , locate help after experiencing sexual violence , and most college campuses have services available to assist with mental health. Pittsburgh colleges and universities have in-house counseling resources: University of Pittsburgh Counseling Center Duquesne Center for Student Wellbeing and counseling services Carnegie Mellon University’s Counseling and Psychological Services Carlow University’s counseling services Chatham University’s Counseling Center Point Park University Counseling Center Community College of Allegheny County’s Counseling Services Off campus, UpStreet , a Pittsburgh-based teen mental health service provider started by Pittsburgh’s Jewish Family and Community Services , offers free online therapy for people ages 12 to 22. For students in immediate crisis, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center offers a free, 24/7 hotline and a walk-in crisis center .
