Her bookPurple Hearts – Back from Iraqexplored the physical and psychological impact of war through portraits of wounded veterans.Landscapes and facesPhotos by Noah AddisNoah Addis is the fifth photographer in a series of six who are documenting the changes to communities throughout Pennsylvania because of Marcellus Shale drilling.In Philadelphia, where Addis lives, “we hear a lot of shouting from activists on both sides of the story, but I’ve seen very little honest, nuanced coverage,” he said. “I personally approached this project without any kind of agenda. I just wanted to take a straightforward look to see how the landscape has been changed by the drilling boom.”One family’s journey with Marcellus ShalePhotos by Scott GoldsmithArticle by Sharon WalshScott Goldsmith was a newcomer to the topic of Marcellus Shale drilling when he began taking photos of the Hallowich family of Western Pennsylvania in 2010.The Hallowiches became well known as the Washington County family that moved into what they thought was their dream home and then had health problems that they believed were caused by drilling on their property.Marcellus Shale’s ‘accidental activists’Photos by Lynn JohnsonArticle by Sharon WalshLynn Johnson is pale.

She has traveled for National Geographic magazine and other publications to places such as Siberia, Zambia and Antarctica.But the latest focal point she has found is in Pennsylvania, among the people she calls “accidental activists” who’ve become involved in the issues surrounding natural gas drilling, the type known as fracking.The landscape of Marcellus ShalePhotos by Brian CohenArticle by Sharon WalshPittsburgh photographer Brian Cohen set out more than a year ago to lead a group of photographers to document the impact of gas drilling on communities atop the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania.Kids and pipelinesPhotos by Martha RialStory and audio by Emily DeMarcoFarmer Jeanne Williams and her 116 goats are waiting for their Greene County hillside to be returned to green pasture.After two months of upheaval as workmen from Precision Pipeline dug a seemingly endless trench, a layer of mud covered the freshly installed pipeline that will ultimately ferry natural gas being extracted from Marcellus Shale deposits."

      "date": "In Pennsylvania, health officials said parents should be more concerned with their children being exposed to peeling lead-based paint and dust that contains lead particles than drinking water contaminated by lead.Click the image to learn more about lead exposure in Pennsylvania from our news partnerKeystone Crossroads:That’s because Pennsylvania has older housing than many states. Nearly 60 percent of homes in the state were built before 1970, when lead-based paint was more likely to be used. Lead-based paint wasn’t banned until 1978.Marilyn Howarth, of theCenter of Excellence in Environmental Toxicologyat the University of Pennsylvania, said people with lower incomes are most at risk for lead exposure. They and their children are more likely to be living in older housing, rental properties, or homes that haven’t been maintained.The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends high-risk children get tested for lead at 9 to 12 months and again at 2 years old. The initial blood lead test is a finger or toe prick; if the results are elevated, the doctor may pull a larger sample from a vein.Tony Pizon, the chief of medical toxicology at UPMC, said a blood lead level above 5 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood is a “trigger of concern” for doctors.More than 13,000 children tested above that 5 microgram level in Pennsylvania, of which 660 were located in Pittsburgh, according to a 2014 Pennsylvania Department of Health report.When a child’s lead blood test is more than 15 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood in Allegheny County, the county health department is notified to do a lead risk assessment. An inspector takes samples of paint, dust, water and soil to determine the origin of the lead exposure and talks to the parents about the child’s activities.Dave Namey, who manages the county’s Housing and Community Environment program, said three to five inspectors conducted nearly 30 risk assessments last year.Lead can be ingested by a crawling baby putting their hands in dust and into their mouths, or a child could be eating paint chips or chewing on a window sill, Namey said.Lead-based paint near windows or doors can flake or peel as they’re used, he added.“Deteriorated paint ends up…getting crushed and pulverized into particles of lead that end up in normal household dust,” Namey said.It can also be tracked into a home from a porch coated in lead-based paint or from tainted soil.Reach Eric Holmberg at 412-315-0266 or ateholmberg@publicsource.org.

      "title": "Wilkinsburg Council reacts to our story about dissolving police forces",
      "author": "",
      "date": "Jan. 22, 2016: We received the following letter from Wilkinsburg Borough Council after our story,“No money, no police force”published:On the same day as your article, “No Money, No Police Force,” was published in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, there was a meet and greet event to welcome six new officers to the Wilkinsburg Police Department and introduce them to the community. As they interacted with an overflowing group of leaders, residents and youth, you couldn’t help but notice the professionalism, enthusiasm and dedication with which this diverse group of youthful officers presented themselves. Joining our new officers were our seasoned veterans of the force and our chief, Ophelia Coleman.This event, and the reality of the Borough present a striking contrast to the dismal, hopeless and inaccurately negative depiction presented in just the opening lines of your article. As the Council of Wilkinsburg, we must respond and share the thoughtful consideration which guides our efforts to lead our community and the successes that we, and our strong allies and partners – Allegheny County, Wilkinsburg Community Development Corporation, Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation, Wilkinsburg Chamber of Commerce and Hosanna House, to name just a few – have experienced and continue to strive for in Wilkinsburg.Like all municipalities, Wilkinsburg’s operating expenses have increased, and our constituents look to us to keep the millage rates in check. As a responsible Council, Wilkinsburg has investigated methods to provide the highest quality service to our residents while seeking simultaneously to save costs and protect our dedicated employees. This includes contracting both our fire and refuse collection with the City of Pittsburgh. These agreements were made over time and insured the best service and resulted in significant savings for the Borough. In the case of our Fire Department, Wilkinsburg firefighters joined the Pittsburgh force. Just three weeks ago, we witnessed firsthand the quality of our public safety as the Pittsburgh Fire Department – partially housed in the Wilkinsburg Borough Building, responded to a fire on Ross Avenue, saving an elderly resident, preventing the spread of the fire and injuring seven firefighters in the process. Our Fire Department – whether in the name of Pittsburgh or Wilkinsburg – were heroes.Let us set the record straight regarding Wilkinsburg’s 2016 budget. The budget adopted for 2016 includes full funding of our police force with no reductions or contracting out of services. While your article briefly mentioned that the suggestion of subcontracting police services was quickly dismissed by Council, this article misrepresented Council and undermined our police officers and police department. Crime in Wilkinsburg is decreasing every year. Our community policing and department, 24 strong, is our biggest asset for our growing diverse community. Our fine officers are backed up by surrounding communities’ police and Allegheny County for major crime investigations. We can’t afford not to have our police force – they do an excellent job.Most importantly, our police officers need to know how much we appreciate them. You can see them at Community Day, our rapidly expanding Block Watch meetings, Biddle’s Escape coffee shop, or Save-A-Lot always greeting residents with a smile. Simply put, they are constant fixtures – watching and protecting all of us.Likewise, Wilkinsburg has made other changes to insure the best service for our residents and to increase revenue. In late 2014, Wilkinsburg Borough, working in partnership with the Wilkinsburg School District hired a new delinquent tax collector. Working collectively, the collections of back taxes have increased dramatically. Too, the Council and School District are seeing an increasing number of properties return to the tax rolls through a variety of programs including Tax Abatement, Enhanced Tax Abatement for Commercial Uses, Tax Compromise, and the Redevelopment Authority of Allegheny County’s Vacant Property Recovery Program.Too, Wilkinsburg has realized that we must proactively address blight and deterioration that is beyond rehabilitation if we are going to attract others to invest in our neighborhoods. With a $250,000 grant of CITF funds from the Redevelopment Authority of Allegheny County combined with up to a half a million dollars from the Borough, Wilkinsburg will, beginning as soon as March, demolish up to 66 properties primarily along the Ardmore Boulevard Corridor leading into our downtown and make infrastructure improvements to the area.In spite of the morbid description, you manage to highlight that Wilkinsburg’s commercial district still hosts a successful family jeweler. Kenyon Jeweler’s does not inhabit an otherwise vacant district; our downtown hosts dozens of successful and growing businesses including grocery, specialty grocery, clothing, shoes, hair salons and supply, banks, eyeglasses, restaurants, florist, paint, hardware and automotive services among other uses. Recent workshops about growing and strengthening your business, sponsored by the WCDC and Wilkinsburg Chamber were beyond capacity as entrepreneurs realize the possibility and potential in locating in Wilkinsburg.Before your next report on the condition and direction of Wilkinsburg, please attend our Council meetings which take place on the first and second Wednesdays of the month at 7:00pm, Council Chambers, 605 Ross Avenue, Wilkinsburg, PA. If you would like to visit Wilkinsburg and discuss the many good things happening in our community and the revitalization we are experiencing, we would be glad to meet with you, take you on a tour and share the great things occurring in Wilkinsburg.Collectively,Wilkinsburg Borough Council605 Ross AvenueWilkinsburg, PA 15221"

      "author": "",
      "date": "We received the following response from Maureen Keefer, Assistant Dean of Students at Robert Morris University, after we published our story, “Campuses in the Pittsburgh area: Diverse? Maybe. Inclusive? Not so much.“A core value at Robert Morris University is that “individuals matter,” and faculty and staff across the institution genuinely embrace this value. Every student’s experience on campus is important to us, so I appreciate the opportunity to respond to your recent article regarding one student’s concerns. I hope to provide some perspective about the work being done at RMU to ensure that our campus is an inclusive and responsive community.In addition to broad diversity training sessions our Office of Diversity, Inclusion and Equity offers regularly to all faculty, staff and students, our Office of Multicultural Student Services provides specific “Safe Zone” training for individuals who want to serve as allies for the LGBTQ community. Faculty and administrators also work closely with our Student Alliance For Equality to support their efforts to ensure a safe and supportive campus environment.Last spring, the university formed a transgender accommodations committee, which I chair. We survey best practices throughout the higher education landscape and evaluate our own campus environment in order to make changes and provide recommendations to our university leadership. One of the first requests brought to our attention was the need to update the university records system to allow students to replace the birth name in their record with a preferred name, both for self identity and to allay any fears about harassment or personal safety. We are sensitive to the concern raised in your article that this is not an easy process. In certain instances, the law requires RMU to recognize students by their legal names. However, we are committed to accommodating students who have this request, and we have modified our records systems accordingly.Your article references a class and a textbook on “deviant behavior,” which are criticized as being “outdated and offensive” [by a student]. This seems to be an unfortunate misunderstanding, one that I hope to clarify. The goal of the sociology course in question is to explore how societies determine cultural norms, how they stigmatize and label groups that don’t identify with those norms, what effects those labels can have and how norms may change over time. It’s especially relevant here, as this process is unfolding today in our society for those who identify as transgender.I hope my comments help to illustrate how we value the contributions of each member of our campus community. “Individuals matter” is ultimately a recognition that every person adds to the richness of the RMU experience. Of course there is still work to be done, and my colleagues and I will continue to look for ways we can support and enhance inclusion and diversity for everyone on our campus.Sincerely,Maureen KeeferAssistant Dean of StudentsRobert Morris University"

      "date": "PublicSource reporterJeffrey Benzingis a Texas native and never more distinct is his Southern drawl than when he is interviewing sources. While reporting on issues of public safety, Jeff’s y’alls seem to have a disarming effect even when he’s discussing the most contentious of issues. Colleagues say he is one of the most patient reporters they know, remaining calm even when working with public officials who have rejected his Right-to-Know requests for information that should be available to you, the public.Jeff says he got into journalism for two reasons: To hold the powerful accountable and to tell human stories. He adds that newsrooms have had fewer and fewer resources for both in recent years. And, “Luckily, I found a home at PublicSource where we’re given the time to go after important stories that too often go underreported.” Jeff recognizes that having that opportunity in journalism in 2018 is by no means a given, and he’s grateful to not only have the chance to pursue those stories but also to have support and encouragement from everyone in the office.Jeff is most proud of PublicSource’s work that amplifies community voices. Most of his stories tend to focus on intense topics, and it’s important for him to go beyond facts and data to show readers that issues like gun violence and unsolved homicides have lasting impacts on their neighbors. “While solutions are slow to come, I hope that our stories can at least change the way people view issues they might otherwise ignore.”He’s also proud to see recent changes in the city after PublicSource’s investigation into police technology programs that have been fully paid for but not implemented. As a result of our reporting, city council is increasing scrutiny of contracts and the city is evaluating a major overhaul to the technology used by police every day.Jeff recently won a Pittsburgh Black Media Federation Robert L. Vann Award of Excellence for his investiation, “From school to jail: How hundreds of kids get arrested in Pittsburgh schools every year.” He and reporter Mary Niederberger are also finalists for the Education Writers Association national award for their stories in the “I am a black girl and…” series.In his spare time (do reporters have that?), he likes to travel, listen to records, attempt to play guitar and explore the many charms of Pittsburgh.Check out stories by PublicSource criminal justice reporter Jeffrey Benzing."
