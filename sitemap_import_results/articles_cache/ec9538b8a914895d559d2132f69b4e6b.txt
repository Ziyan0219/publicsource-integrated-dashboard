Western Australia's Kwinana is scarred, and Yarloop is divided. As red dust swirls and sludge lakes loom, Pinjarra residents wonder if the mining money is worth the sacrifices. Alcoa owns three sprawling refineries in Western Australia, where ore mined from the endangered jarrah forest is processed into alumina. The refineries produce hazardous emissions, which have led to lawsuits, worker complaints and home buyouts in the communities of Kwinana and Yarloop. The toxic residue is stored in vast piles of mud that have grown bigger than the nearby town of Pinjarra, home to Alcoa’s third and largest refinery. Residents say winds whip the residue into clouds of red dust that reach homes and lungs for miles around. Testing shows locals with elevated levels of lead, arsenic and uranium. People report CPAP filters clogged with dust; some moved away in hopes of easing children’s respiratory conditions.
