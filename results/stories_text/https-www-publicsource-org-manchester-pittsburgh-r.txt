Update (1/10/25): Department of City Planning officials, in a Jan. 9 letter, awarded registered community organization status to Manchester Neighbors.
As the ambitious Esplanade project and its proposed Ferris wheel edged toward Pittsburgh City Planning Commission consideration, a year-old organization of advocates for the nearby Manchester neighborhood sought to have a voice.
Manchester Neighbors asked, on Aug. 23, to become a registered community organization [RCO] for the area. Manchester didn’t have an RCO, and that designation would allow the group to hold development activities meetings [DAMs] with developers coming to the area, plus work with city officials on neighborhood plans.
Nineteen weeks later, that group’s application had not been acted upon. But on Nov. 1, another applicant — the Manchester Chateau Partnership Alliance — was approved as the neighborhood RCO, despite having applied for the designation after Manchester Neighbors.
While a few parts of the city — notably including the Hill District — have multiple registered community organizations , most have just one RCO.
In October, Manchester Citizens Council Executive Director LaShawn Burton-Faulk urged city officials to approve the alliance’s application. Burton-Faulk is also the chair of the City Planning Commission and a member of the Zoning Board of Adjustment, both of which work closely with the City Planning Department.
Here’s a timeline of competing applications, based largely on documents received by PublicSource through a request for city records. Oct. 16, 2023 Manchester Neighbors launched to “emphasize the need for the inclusion of all Manchester residents” in city development decisions affecting the neighborhood. June 25, 2024 Seven organizations serving Manchester and Chateau discuss the need for “a unified alliance” for those neighborhoods, leading within a week to the formation of the Manchester Chateau Partnership Alliance. The founding document does not mention becoming an RCO. July 18, 2024 Manchester Neighbors holds a meeting and discusses the option of becoming an RCO. Aug. 14, 2024 Pittsburgh Councilman R. Daniel Lavelle pens a letter supporting the as-yet-unsubmitted application by the Manchester Chateau Partnership for RCO status. Pittsburgh City Councilman R. Daniel Lavelle in his office in the City-County Building, Downtown. (Photo by Jay Manning/ PublicSource) Aug. 23, 2024 Manchester Neighbors petitions Lavelle, with 38 signatures, indicating that the group is seeking RCO status and asking for his support. An application submitted to the city shows 13 board members, at least nine of whom live in Manchester. Aug. 27, 2024 Burton-Faulk writes to Lavelle and Planning Department officials with a separate application for RCO status on behalf of the Manchester Chateau Partnership Alliance, listing seven potential board members — with organizational ties to the area, but five of whom live outside of the neighborhoods in the alliance’s name — plus Burton-Faulk as a contact person. The application package includes a letter of support from the councilman. Sept. 11, 2024 Planning officials write to Burton-Faulk to set up a Zoom meeting about the alliance’s application. Sept. 12, 2024 Stanley Lowe, an advisor to Manchester Neighbors, writes to Planning Director Jamil Bey asking for a status report on that group’s RCO application. Bey responds promptly that the department does not yet have an endorsement letter from Lavelle — a prerequisite for RCO status. Stanley Lowe leads a meeting of Manchester Neighbors at his house on November 8 in Manchester. (Michael Swensen for PublicSource) Sept. 30, 2024 Per Zoom invites, the alliance backers and planning department officials hold a virtual meeting. Oct. 11, 2024 Planning officials email a reminder to Burton-Faulk that they need a revised map outlining the area the alliance seeks to represent. The planning official recommends that the alliance create “a pathway” by which residents of the neighborhoods can serve on the alliance’s board. Oct. 15, 2024 Developer Piatt Companies conducts the first of two briefings on the $740 million Esplanade development proposal before the City Planning Commission. Oct. 22, 2024 Burton-Faulk writes to planning officials, copying Lavelle, seeking an update on the alliance’s application and criticizing the neighbors group.

Separately, the Manchester Citizens Council [MCC], led by Burton-Faulk, sues Lowe and Manchester Neighbors alleging that they sought to infringe on MCC’s name and logo. Nov. 8, 2024 After PublicSource inquires with Burton-Faulk about the alliance’s RCO application, she writes to planning officials urging them to “Get a hold of your mole!!” Excerpt from LaShawn Burton-Faulk’s email to City Planning officials of Nov. 8. A planning official responds with an email that starts with, “Hi Sweetheart,” to which Burton-Faulk replies, “Hello beautiful!” Burton-Faulk also writes to planning officials asking: “Who internally is sharing trusted city of Pittsburgh information outside of city process???” and suggesting that “an internal employee” must be leaking information. Planning officials reach out to Lowe, saying they recently received Lavelle’s endorsement of the Manchester Neighbors RCO application. They ask for a meeting with the neighbors group. Nov. 11, 2024 PublicSource publishes a story about the Manchester RCO situation. Nov. 12, 2024 With Burton-Faulk recusing herself, the City Planning Commission hears endorsements of Esplanade from MCC and from Lowe, and votes in favor of the site’s master plan. Going forward, the commission is expected to vote on each phase of the development. An artist’s conception of the proposed Esplanade development, submitted by Piatt Companies and consultants to the City Planning Commission ahead of a Nov. 12 hearing on the plan for a site along the Ohio River in Pittsburgh’s Chateau neighborhood. Nov. 14, 2024 Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas Judge Christine Ward approves a consent agreement between MCC and Manchester Neighbors and Lowe, barring Lowe and Manchester Neighbors from using MCC’s name and logo. Jan. 2, 2025 Manchester Neighbors tells PublicSource that it believes it has provided all of the information the Department of City Planning has requested, but has not yet received a decision on its RCO application. Jan. 6, 2025 In response to questions from PublicSource, Department of City Planning officials indicate that action on the Manchester Neighbors application for RCO status may be imminent.

<p><em>Update (1/10/25): Department of City Planning officials, in a Jan. 9 letter, <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/manchester-neighbors-rco-registered-community-organization-esplanade-development/">awarded registered community organization status</a> to Manchester Neighbors. </em></p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />
<p>As the ambitious <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/esplanade-city-planning-commission-approval-manchester-chateau-ferris-wheel/">Esplanade project</a> and its proposed Ferris wheel edged toward Pittsburgh City Planning Commission consideration, a year-old organization of advocates for the nearby Manchester neighborhood sought to have a voice.</p>
<p>Manchester Neighbors asked, on Aug. 23, to become a registered community organization [RCO] for the area. Manchester didn’t have an RCO, and <a href="https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/Planning/Planning-Programs/Registered-Community-Organizations">that designation would allow</a> the group to hold development activities meetings [DAMs] with developers coming to the area, plus work with city officials on neighborhood plans.</p>
<p>Nineteen weeks later, that group’s application had not been acted upon. But on Nov. 1, another applicant — the Manchester Chateau Partnership Alliance — was approved as the neighborhood RCO, despite having applied for the designation after Manchester Neighbors.</p>
<p>While a few parts of the city — notably including <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/hill-district-pittsburgh-development-penguins-fenway-sports-civic-arena/">the Hill District</a> — have multiple <a href="https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/Planning/Planning-Programs/Registered-Community-Organizations/Who%E2%80%99s-My-RCO">registered community organizations</a>, most have just one RCO.</p>
<p>In October, Manchester Citizens Council Executive Director LaShawn Burton-Faulk urged city officials to approve the alliance’s application. Burton-Faulk is also the chair of the City Planning Commission and a member of the Zoning Board of Adjustment, both of which work closely with the City Planning Department.</p>
<p>Here’s a timeline of competing applications, based largely on documents received by PublicSource through a request for city records.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oct. 16, 2023</strong></h4>
<p>Manchester Neighbors launched to “emphasize the need for the inclusion of all Manchester residents” in city development decisions affecting the neighborhood.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong>June 25, 2024</strong></strong></h4>
<p>Seven organizations serving Manchester and Chateau discuss the need for “a unified alliance” for those neighborhoods, leading within a week to the formation of the Manchester Chateau Partnership Alliance. The founding document does not mention becoming an RCO.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong>July 18, 2024</strong></strong></h4>

<p>Manchester Neighbors petitions Lavelle, with 38 signatures, indicating that the group is seeking RCO status and asking for his support. An application submitted to the city shows 13 board members, at least nine of whom live in Manchester.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Aug. 27, 2024</strong></h4>
<p>Burton-Faulk writes to Lavelle and Planning Department officials with a separate application for RCO status on behalf of the Manchester Chateau Partnership Alliance, listing seven potential board members — with organizational ties to the area, but five of whom live outside of the neighborhoods in the alliance’s name — plus Burton-Faulk as a contact person. The application package includes a letter of support from the councilman.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sept. 11, 2024</strong></h4>
<p>Planning officials write to Burton-Faulk to set up a Zoom meeting about the alliance’s application.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sept. 12, 2024</strong></h4>
<p>Stanley Lowe, an advisor to Manchester Neighbors, writes to Planning Director Jamil Bey asking for a status report on that group’s RCO application. Bey responds promptly that the department does not yet have an endorsement letter from Lavelle — a prerequisite for RCO status.</p>

Timeline: How Pittsburgh officials decided who speaks for Manchester by Rich Lord, PublicSource January 7, 2025 <h1>Timeline: How Pittsburgh officials decided who speaks for Manchester</h1>
<p class="byline">by Rich Lord, PublicSource <br />January 7, 2025</p>
					
<p><em>Update (1/10/25): Department of City Planning officials, in a Jan. 9 letter, <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/manchester-neighbors-rco-registered-community-organization-esplanade-development/">awarded registered community organization status</a> to Manchester Neighbors. </em></p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />
<p>As the ambitious <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/esplanade-city-planning-commission-approval-manchester-chateau-ferris-wheel/">Esplanade project</a> and its proposed Ferris wheel edged toward Pittsburgh City Planning Commission consideration, a year-old organization of advocates for the nearby Manchester neighborhood sought to have a voice.</p>
<p>Manchester Neighbors asked, on Aug. 23, to become a registered community organization [RCO] for the area. Manchester didn’t have an RCO, and <a href="https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/Planning/Planning-Programs/Registered-Community-Organizations">that designation would allow</a> the group to hold development activities meetings [DAMs] with developers coming to the area, plus work with city officials on neighborhood plans.</p>
<p>Nineteen weeks later, that group’s application had not been acted upon. But on Nov. 1, another applicant — the Manchester Chateau Partnership Alliance — was approved as the neighborhood RCO, despite having applied for the designation after Manchester Neighbors.</p>
<p>While a few parts of the city — notably including <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/hill-district-pittsburgh-development-penguins-fenway-sports-civic-arena/">the Hill District</a> — have multiple <a href="https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/Planning/Planning-Programs/Registered-Community-Organizations/Who%E2%80%99s-My-RCO">registered community organizations</a>, most have just one RCO.</p>
<p>In October, Manchester Citizens Council Executive Director LaShawn Burton-Faulk urged city officials to approve the alliance’s application. Burton-Faulk is also the chair of the City Planning Commission and a member of the Zoning Board of Adjustment, both of which work closely with the City Planning Department.</p>
<p>Here’s a timeline of competing applications, based largely on documents received by PublicSource through a request for city records.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oct. 16, 2023</strong></h4>
<p>Manchester Neighbors launched to “emphasize the need for the inclusion of all Manchester residents” in city development decisions affecting the neighborhood.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong>June 25, 2024</strong></strong></h4>
<p>Seven organizations serving Manchester and Chateau discuss the need for “a unified alliance” for those neighborhoods, leading within a week to the formation of the Manchester Chateau Partnership Alliance. The founding document does not mention becoming an RCO.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong>July 18, 2024</strong></strong></h4>
<p>Manchester Neighbors holds a meeting and discusses the option of becoming an RCO.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong><strong>Aug. 14, 2024</strong></strong></strong></h4>
<p>Pittsburgh Councilman R. Daniel Lavelle pens a letter supporting the as-yet-unsubmitted application by the Manchester Chateau Partnership for RCO status.</p>

Daniel Lavelle in his office in the City-County Building, Downtown. (Photo by Jay Manning/ PublicSource)</figcaption></figure>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Aug. 23, 2024</strong></h4>
<p>Manchester Neighbors petitions Lavelle, with 38 signatures, indicating that the group is seeking RCO status and asking for his support. An application submitted to the city shows 13 board members, at least nine of whom live in Manchester.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Aug. 27, 2024</strong></h4>
<p>Burton-Faulk writes to Lavelle and Planning Department officials with a separate application for RCO status on behalf of the Manchester Chateau Partnership Alliance, listing seven potential board members — with organizational ties to the area, but five of whom live outside of the neighborhoods in the alliance’s name — plus Burton-Faulk as a contact person. The application package includes a letter of support from the councilman.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sept. 11, 2024</strong></h4>
<p>Planning officials write to Burton-Faulk to set up a Zoom meeting about the alliance’s application.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sept. 12, 2024</strong></h4>
<p>Stanley Lowe, an advisor to Manchester Neighbors, writes to Planning Director Jamil Bey asking for a status report on that group’s RCO application. Bey responds promptly that the department does not yet have an endorsement letter from Lavelle — a prerequisite for RCO status.</p>

<p class="byline">by Rich Lord, PublicSource <br />January 7, 2025</p>
					
<p><em>Update (1/10/25): Department of City Planning officials, in a Jan. 9 letter, <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/manchester-neighbors-rco-registered-community-organization-esplanade-development/">awarded registered community organization status</a> to Manchester Neighbors. </em></p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />
<p>As the ambitious <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/esplanade-city-planning-commission-approval-manchester-chateau-ferris-wheel/">Esplanade project</a> and its proposed Ferris wheel edged toward Pittsburgh City Planning Commission consideration, a year-old organization of advocates for the nearby Manchester neighborhood sought to have a voice.</p>
<p>Manchester Neighbors asked, on Aug. 23, to become a registered community organization [RCO] for the area. Manchester didn’t have an RCO, and <a href="https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/Planning/Planning-Programs/Registered-Community-Organizations">that designation would allow</a> the group to hold development activities meetings [DAMs] with developers coming to the area, plus work with city officials on neighborhood plans.</p>
<p>Nineteen weeks later, that group’s application had not been acted upon. But on Nov. 1, another applicant — the Manchester Chateau Partnership Alliance — was approved as the neighborhood RCO, despite having applied for the designation after Manchester Neighbors.</p>
<p>While a few parts of the city — notably including <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/hill-district-pittsburgh-development-penguins-fenway-sports-civic-arena/">the Hill District</a> — have multiple <a href="https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/Planning/Planning-Programs/Registered-Community-Organizations/Who%E2%80%99s-My-RCO">registered community organizations</a>, most have just one RCO.</p>
<p>In October, Manchester Citizens Council Executive Director LaShawn Burton-Faulk urged city officials to approve the alliance’s application. Burton-Faulk is also the chair of the City Planning Commission and a member of the Zoning Board of Adjustment, both of which work closely with the City Planning Department.</p>
<p>Here’s a timeline of competing applications, based largely on documents received by PublicSource through a request for city records.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oct. 16, 2023</strong></h4>
<p>Manchester Neighbors launched to “emphasize the need for the inclusion of all Manchester residents” in city development decisions affecting the neighborhood.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong>June 25, 2024</strong></strong></h4>
<p>Seven organizations serving Manchester and Chateau discuss the need for “a unified alliance” for those neighborhoods, leading within a week to the formation of the Manchester Chateau Partnership Alliance. The founding document does not mention becoming an RCO.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong>July 18, 2024</strong></strong></h4>
<p>Manchester Neighbors holds a meeting and discusses the option of becoming an RCO.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong><strong>Aug. 14, 2024</strong></strong></strong></h4>
<p>Pittsburgh Councilman R. Daniel Lavelle pens a letter supporting the as-yet-unsubmitted application by the Manchester Chateau Partnership for RCO status.</p>

Daniel Lavelle in his office in the City-County Building, Downtown. (Photo by Jay Manning/ PublicSource)</figcaption></figure>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Aug. 23, 2024</strong></h4>
<p>Manchester Neighbors petitions Lavelle, with 38 signatures, indicating that the group is seeking RCO status and asking for his support. An application submitted to the city shows 13 board members, at least nine of whom live in Manchester.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Aug. 27, 2024</strong></h4>
<p>Burton-Faulk writes to Lavelle and Planning Department officials with a separate application for RCO status on behalf of the Manchester Chateau Partnership Alliance, listing seven potential board members — with organizational ties to the area, but five of whom live outside of the neighborhoods in the alliance’s name — plus Burton-Faulk as a contact person. The application package includes a letter of support from the councilman.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sept. 11, 2024</strong></h4>
<p>Planning officials write to Burton-Faulk to set up a Zoom meeting about the alliance’s application.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sept. 12, 2024</strong></h4>
<p>Stanley Lowe, an advisor to Manchester Neighbors, writes to Planning Director Jamil Bey asking for a status report on that group’s RCO application. Bey responds promptly that the department does not yet have an endorsement letter from Lavelle — a prerequisite for RCO status.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oct. 11, 2024</strong></h4>
<p>Planning officials email a reminder to Burton-Faulk that they need a revised map outlining the area the alliance seeks to represent. The planning official recommends that the alliance create “a pathway” by which residents of the neighborhoods can serve on the alliance’s board.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oct. 15, 2024</strong></h4>
<p>Developer Piatt Companies conducts the <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/esplanade-development-north-shore-pittsburgh-city-planning-commission/">first of two briefings</a> on the $740 million Esplanade development proposal before the City Planning Commission.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Nov. 8, 2024</strong></h4>
<p>After PublicSource inquires with Burton-Faulk about the alliance’s RCO application, she writes to planning officials urging them to “Get a hold of your mole!!”</p>

<p class="byline">by Rich Lord, PublicSource <br />January 7, 2025</p>
					
<p><em>Update (1/10/25): Department of City Planning officials, in a Jan. 9 letter, <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/manchester-neighbors-rco-registered-community-organization-esplanade-development/">awarded registered community organization status</a> to Manchester Neighbors. </em></p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />
<p>As the ambitious <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/esplanade-city-planning-commission-approval-manchester-chateau-ferris-wheel/">Esplanade project</a> and its proposed Ferris wheel edged toward Pittsburgh City Planning Commission consideration, a year-old organization of advocates for the nearby Manchester neighborhood sought to have a voice.</p>
<p>Manchester Neighbors asked, on Aug. 23, to become a registered community organization [RCO] for the area. Manchester didn’t have an RCO, and <a href="https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/Planning/Planning-Programs/Registered-Community-Organizations">that designation would allow</a> the group to hold development activities meetings [DAMs] with developers coming to the area, plus work with city officials on neighborhood plans.</p>
<p>Nineteen weeks later, that group’s application had not been acted upon. But on Nov. 1, another applicant — the Manchester Chateau Partnership Alliance — was approved as the neighborhood RCO, despite having applied for the designation after Manchester Neighbors.</p>
<p>While a few parts of the city — notably including <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/hill-district-pittsburgh-development-penguins-fenway-sports-civic-arena/">the Hill District</a> — have multiple <a href="https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/Planning/Planning-Programs/Registered-Community-Organizations/Who%E2%80%99s-My-RCO">registered community organizations</a>, most have just one RCO.</p>
<p>In October, Manchester Citizens Council Executive Director LaShawn Burton-Faulk urged city officials to approve the alliance’s application. Burton-Faulk is also the chair of the City Planning Commission and a member of the Zoning Board of Adjustment, both of which work closely with the City Planning Department.</p>
<p>Here’s a timeline of competing applications, based largely on documents received by PublicSource through a request for city records.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oct. 16, 2023</strong></h4>
<p>Manchester Neighbors launched to “emphasize the need for the inclusion of all Manchester residents” in city development decisions affecting the neighborhood.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong>June 25, 2024</strong></strong></h4>
<p>Seven organizations serving Manchester and Chateau discuss the need for “a unified alliance” for those neighborhoods, leading within a week to the formation of the Manchester Chateau Partnership Alliance. The founding document does not mention becoming an RCO.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong>July 18, 2024</strong></strong></h4>
<p>Manchester Neighbors holds a meeting and discusses the option of becoming an RCO.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong><strong>Aug. 14, 2024</strong></strong></strong></h4>
<p>Pittsburgh Councilman R. Daniel Lavelle pens a letter supporting the as-yet-unsubmitted application by the Manchester Chateau Partnership for RCO status.</p>

Daniel Lavelle in his office in the City-County Building, Downtown. (Photo by Jay Manning/ PublicSource)</figcaption></figure>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Aug. 23, 2024</strong></h4>
<p>Manchester Neighbors petitions Lavelle, with 38 signatures, indicating that the group is seeking RCO status and asking for his support. An application submitted to the city shows 13 board members, at least nine of whom live in Manchester.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Aug. 27, 2024</strong></h4>
<p>Burton-Faulk writes to Lavelle and Planning Department officials with a separate application for RCO status on behalf of the Manchester Chateau Partnership Alliance, listing seven potential board members — with organizational ties to the area, but five of whom live outside of the neighborhoods in the alliance’s name — plus Burton-Faulk as a contact person. The application package includes a letter of support from the councilman.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sept. 11, 2024</strong></h4>
<p>Planning officials write to Burton-Faulk to set up a Zoom meeting about the alliance’s application.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sept. 12, 2024</strong></h4>
<p>Stanley Lowe, an advisor to Manchester Neighbors, writes to Planning Director Jamil Bey asking for a status report on that group’s RCO application. Bey responds promptly that the department does not yet have an endorsement letter from Lavelle — a prerequisite for RCO status.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.publicsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024_Swensen_PublicSource_Manchester-1323-scaled.jpg" alt="An older man in a black shirt clasps his hands together, seated indoors near a wooden frame with family photos and a window with blinds and an air conditioning unit." class="wp-image-1312572" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Stanley Lowe leads a meeting of Manchester Neighbors at his house on November 8 in Manchester.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sept. 30, 2024</strong></h4>
<p>Per Zoom invites, the alliance backers and planning department officials hold a virtual meeting.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oct. 11, 2024</strong></h4>
<p>Planning officials email a reminder to Burton-Faulk that they need a revised map outlining the area the alliance seeks to represent. The planning official recommends that the alliance create “a pathway” by which residents of the neighborhoods can serve on the alliance’s board.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oct. 15, 2024</strong></h4>
<p>Developer Piatt Companies conducts the <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/esplanade-development-north-shore-pittsburgh-city-planning-commission/">first of two briefings</a> on the $740 million Esplanade development proposal before the City Planning Commission.</p>

Manchester didn’t have an RCO, and <a href="https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/Planning/Planning-Programs/Registered-Community-Organizations">that designation would allow</a> the group to hold development activities meetings [DAMs] with developers coming to the area, plus work with city officials on neighborhood plans.</p>
<p>Nineteen weeks later, that group’s application had not been acted upon. But on Nov. 1, another applicant — the Manchester Chateau Partnership Alliance — was approved as the neighborhood RCO, despite having applied for the designation after Manchester Neighbors.</p>
<p>While a few parts of the city — notably including <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/hill-district-pittsburgh-development-penguins-fenway-sports-civic-arena/">the Hill District</a> — have multiple <a href="https://www.pittsburghpa.gov/Business-Development/Planning/Planning-Programs/Registered-Community-Organizations/Who%E2%80%99s-My-RCO">registered community organizations</a>, most have just one RCO.</p>
<p>In October, Manchester Citizens Council Executive Director LaShawn Burton-Faulk urged city officials to approve the alliance’s application. Burton-Faulk is also the chair of the City Planning Commission and a member of the Zoning Board of Adjustment, both of which work closely with the City Planning Department.</p>
<p>Here’s a timeline of competing applications, based largely on documents received by PublicSource through a request for city records.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oct. 16, 2023</strong></h4>
<p>Manchester Neighbors launched to “emphasize the need for the inclusion of all Manchester residents” in city development decisions affecting the neighborhood.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong>June 25, 2024</strong></strong></h4>
<p>Seven organizations serving Manchester and Chateau discuss the need for “a unified alliance” for those neighborhoods, leading within a week to the formation of the Manchester Chateau Partnership Alliance. The founding document does not mention becoming an RCO.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong>July 18, 2024</strong></strong></h4>
<p>Manchester Neighbors holds a meeting and discusses the option of becoming an RCO.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong><strong>Aug. 14, 2024</strong></strong></strong></h4>
<p>Pittsburgh Councilman R. Daniel Lavelle pens a letter supporting the as-yet-unsubmitted application by the Manchester Chateau Partnership for RCO status.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Aug. 23, 2024</strong></h4>
<p>Manchester Neighbors petitions Lavelle, with 38 signatures, indicating that the group is seeking RCO status and asking for his support. An application submitted to the city shows 13 board members, at least nine of whom live in Manchester.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Aug. 27, 2024</strong></h4>
<p>Burton-Faulk writes to Lavelle and Planning Department officials with a separate application for RCO status on behalf of the Manchester Chateau Partnership Alliance, listing seven potential board members — with organizational ties to the area, but five of whom live outside of the neighborhoods in the alliance’s name — plus Burton-Faulk as a contact person. The application package includes a letter of support from the councilman.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sept. 11, 2024</strong></h4>
<p>Planning officials write to Burton-Faulk to set up a Zoom meeting about the alliance’s application.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sept. 12, 2024</strong></h4>
<p>Stanley Lowe, an advisor to Manchester Neighbors, writes to Planning Director Jamil Bey asking for a status report on that group’s RCO application. Bey responds promptly that the department does not yet have an endorsement letter from Lavelle — a prerequisite for RCO status.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oct. 11, 2024</strong></h4>
<p>Planning officials email a reminder to Burton-Faulk that they need a revised map outlining the area the alliance seeks to represent. The planning official recommends that the alliance create “a pathway” by which residents of the neighborhoods can serve on the alliance’s board.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oct. 15, 2024</strong></h4>
<p>Developer Piatt Companies conducts the <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/esplanade-development-north-shore-pittsburgh-city-planning-commission/">first of two briefings</a> on the $740 million Esplanade development proposal before the City Planning Commission.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oct. 22, 2024</strong></h4>
<p>Burton-Faulk writes to planning officials, copying Lavelle, seeking an update on the alliance’s application and criticizing the neighbors group.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.publicsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Burton-Faulk-102224.png" alt="Text of an email alleging a delay in MCPA RCO status approval, mentioning Stanley Lowe and Manchester Neighbors, and noting support from Councilman Lavelle and a state representative." class="wp-image-1314450" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Excerpt from LaShawn Burton-Faulk’s email to City Planning officials of Oct. 22.</figcaption></figure>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oct. 28, 2024</strong></h4>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oct. 29, 2024</strong></h4>

<p>Separately, the Manchester Citizens Council [MCC], led by Burton-Faulk, sues Lowe and Manchester Neighbors alleging that they sought to infringe on MCC’s name and logo.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Nov. 8, 2024</strong></h4>
<p>After PublicSource inquires with Burton-Faulk about the alliance’s RCO application, she writes to planning officials urging them to “Get a hold of your mole!!”</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.publicsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2024-12-20-151117.png" alt="Image of text: &quot;Who at the city is sharing RCO information?! This leads to mistrust as this hasn’t even been announced, nor have we had our kick off meeting with the city to understand our next steps.&quot;" class="wp-image-1314451" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Excerpt from LaShawn Burton-Faulk’s email to City Planning officials of Nov. 8.</figcaption></figure>
<p>A planning official responds with an email that starts with, “Hi Sweetheart,” to which Burton-Faulk replies, “Hello beautiful!”</p>
<p>Burton-Faulk also writes to planning officials asking: “Who internally is sharing trusted city of Pittsburgh information outside of city process???” and suggesting that “an internal employee” must be leaking information.</p>
<p>Planning officials reach out to Lowe, saying they recently received Lavelle’s endorsement of the Manchester Neighbors RCO application. They ask for a meeting with the neighbors group.</p>

Going forward, the commission is expected to vote on each phase of the development.</p>
