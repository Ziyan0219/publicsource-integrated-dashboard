Hi there! I'm writing to summarize the key discussion points and action items from our meeting:

1. Required Resources from Your Team

We need the following materials to proceed with the map system integration:

Two images representing Pittsburgh and county respectively
Official names of the 8 regions you are currently using in your system
Once we receive these materials, I will make the corresponding modifications to our map system.

2. Backend Performance Issues

I've identified a performance issue with our backend system. While it remains functional, the processing speed is significantly slower than expected. I suspect this may be related to the backend service host configuration, and I'm currently investigating the root cause.

3. Proposed Solution

To expedite the process, I suggest we explore the possibility of downloading the complete program from the GitHub repository I provided and running it locally. I can also provide an Excel spreadsheet to facilitate direct data matching.

4. AI Application Development

Our team is actively brainstorming potential AI applications for this project. We're excited to present some innovative ideas at our next meeting.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on any of these points. I look forward to receiving the requested materials at your earliest convenience.

Best regards,

Ziyan Xin
