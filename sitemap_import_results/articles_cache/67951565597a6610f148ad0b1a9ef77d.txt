(Photo by Justin Hayhurst/100 Days in Appalachia) A key vote on a local developer’s plans to create retail and housing space is once again being delayed, this time until Sept. 3, due to concerns over parking and sidewalk space. Plans to expand Bakery Square by 14 acres with retail and apartment complexes along Penn Avenue in East Liberty and Larimer date back two years, but Shadyside-based developer Walnut Capital will have to wait a little longer after Pittsburgh’s City Planning Commission voted Tuesday to delay their final vote on the project to allow for more time in the planning process. The developer’s representatives briefed the commissioners earlier this month and the project was scheduled for a vote on Tuesday. At the beginning of the meeting, planner Kate Rakus said that the developer had addressed commissioners’ concerns about sidewalk creation, elimination of surface parking and ground floor transparency. But as the meeting progressed several commissioners expressed hesitation with voting on the project. “We want to continue to benefit the community in the area with guidelines for good design,” said Commissioner Rachel O’Neill, speaking to Walnut Capital’s team. “We were asking for more last time in terms of setbacks. We’re not seeing much movement on your side. We want to see something a little bit more. I haven’t heard anything different.” Walnut Capital’s representatives began working with community members five years ago on plans to expand Bakery Square, and then-City Councilor Ricky Burgess proposed an expansion bill in 2023. The matter was referred to the commission because the plans call for the expansion of a specially planned district to replace highway zoning, allowing Walnut Capital to realize all of their construction plans. “We didn’t make additional changes because we thought we were at a good urban design place,” said Todd Reidbord, president of Walnut Capital.  “Going beyond that would create a hybrid design that doesn’t have a basis in good urban design. We believe this is a very viable proposal. We’ve put our best foot forward and our architects are saying this is good design so we feel very strongly about it.” Nine months ago those plans revived through a proposal to use Housing Choice Vouchers, commonly referred to as Section 8, to raise additional funding while providing low income tenants with 10% of housing units built in the expansion. Earlier this month those plans appeared to be ready and the commission scheduled the project expansion for a vote. Tuesday’s meeting began with indications that the project could be approved. “This is a two-year process,” Reidbord said. “We think we have a consensus. A [Community Benefits Agreement] has been signed. This [specially planned] district is something we’re proud of. It’s the best tool that the city can use to create mixed-use environments.” Walnut Capital’s attorney Jonathan Kamin thanked  representatives of the Larimer Consensus Group and the Village Collaborative serving East Liberty for attending the meeting and voicing their support for the project.. Both groups signed an agreement that requires Walnut Capital to provide financial and logistical support to enrich the surrounding communities. “The current site is ‘80s vintage typical of suburbs,” Kamin said, noting that Walnut was still aiming to partner with the Housing Authority City of Pittsburgh for access to vouchers though nothing has been finalized. Under Walnut Capital’s plan, the Bakery Square expansion would be divided into five phases, each with its own unique geography and planning considerations.

He said that their plans call for a reduced number of surface parking spaces, limiting that to 25% of the total spaces. “To say no more surface parking in Bakery Square doesn’t fit with the character,” he said.  “It’s not to our financial advantage to have lots of surface parking. But the reality is we need some surface parking.” During the meeting, Reidbord was surprised to learn that Walnut Capital would be responsible for funding infrastructure changes. “Today is the first indication that the burden is put on us,” Reidbord said. “I don’t think it’s acceptable to us. Not feasible. This really came out of left field.” The meeting was opened to comments from the public. Denna Davis, vice chair of Larimer Consensus Group, said that Reidbord was off by a few years when he said how long this project has been in the works. “It’s been five years we’ve been doing this. I really support the project,” Davis said and noted that there were two houses currently being built through the cooperation and support of Walnut Capital’s commitment to fund community initiatives to build and rehabilitate houses for low-income buyers. Other community leaders also voiced their support for the project. Sarah Providence, a resident of the Village of Shadyside community, asked about what would happen to the businesses currently occupying the planned expansion zone. “The only one I’ve heard about is Trader Joe’s because there would be a mutiny if it didn’t stay there, but there’s a vet hospital and other businesses there,” Providence said. Kamin said that the plan “at this point” is for Trader Joe’s to remain in its current building and as the surrounding area gets redeveloped, “we are hopeful that existing businesses will become tenants in our new buildings.” The commission is not meeting in August.
