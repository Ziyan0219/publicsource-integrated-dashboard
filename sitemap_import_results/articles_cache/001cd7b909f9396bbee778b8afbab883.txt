Posted in Shelter Stakes Need for shelter keeps rising two years after Second Avenue Commons opened Allegheny County, the City of Pittsburgh and private partners opened a new hub for addressing homelessness in late 2022. Here are milestones in shelter and services since that time. by Rich Lord December 16, 2024 Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X Lisa Frank, chief operating and administrative officer for the City of Pittsburgh, responds to activists who delivered a stack of letters demanding that Mayor Ed Gainey end all encampment sweeps, Friday, Dec. 6, 2024, at the City-County Building in Downtown.

In late November 2022, as the Second Avenue Commons shelter opened, the same county dashboard showed fewer than 700 unhoused people. In addition to rising numbers, the last two years have been marked by big changes in the ways in which the county and the City of Pittsburgh respond to homelessness. PublicSource has covered those shifts, and the lives of people affected by them, in its Shelter Stakes series. With more change afoot, here’s a lookback at two years of housing instability. November 2022 After several weeks of delays, the Second Avenue Commons shelter opened in Uptown, with an initial 95 beds and space for an additional 30 overflow beds. Construction continues on the Second Avenue Commons on Aug. 11, 2022, in Uptown.

The county also funded the longstanding emergency shelter at the Smithfield United Church of Christ, Downtown.

(Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/PublicSource) April 2023 A PublicSource investigation showed that the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh was administering the Housing Choice Voucher program — often referred to as Section 8 — in a way that was deterring some landlords from participating. HACP officials later pledged to improve Section 8 management.

The county announced that the Smithfield shelter would close the following month. Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey asked advocates for advice on homelessness, and some told PublicSource what they thought local leaders should know.

Allegheny County went through with plans to close the Smithfield shelter, upending the fragile lives of many unhoused people and bringing spirited debate , with just one point of broad agreement , to County Council. Jon Colburn, parish administrator at Smithfield United Church of Christ, and Aubrey Plesh, founder of Team PSBG which operated the church shelter, speak to Allegheny County Council.

(Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/PublicSource) November 2023 The county announced plans to accommodate as many as 450 people on cold winter nights. The county later added that the City of Pittsburgh’s Ammon Recreation Center in the Hill District would become an emergency shelter when temperatures drop below 26 degrees. A PublicSource probe revealed that one layer of the shelter safety net — single room occupancy housing — was seeing accelerated evictions .

(Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/PublicSource) April 2024 Housing advocates and unhoused people alleged that Second Avenue Commons — billed as “low-barrier” housing — was kicking out residents for “minor infractions” of its rules. Shelter management characterized the accusations as vague and defended its “reasonable rules.” Activist and community organizer Sam Schmidt and Howard Ramsey, both of the Our Streets Collective, leave Second Avenue Commons after delivering a letter to leadership on April 19, 2024. (Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/PublicSource) June 2024 A fire at Second Avenue Commons forced the county to find alternatives for some 180 people who were then using its various housing offerings. Days later, County Executive Sara Innamorato announced a plan to bring online 500 housing units in 500 days .

With the cornerstone of the shelter system uninhabitable, advocates and social service providers sought to address needs.

(Photo by Stephanie Strasburg/PublicSource) October 2024 The county announced the reopening of Second Avenue Commons, plus its plans for emergency shelter during the impending winter. The plan would accommodate as many as 600 people on cold days, with a new facility in Perry South serving as a second anchor.
