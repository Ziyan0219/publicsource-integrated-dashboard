The comment period will start Monday and run  through Wednesday, June 18. Public comments will be accepted in writing or at hearings for which dates and times have yet to be announced. The vote follows a committee meeting last week at which PRT board members heard details of changes that might be necessitated with flat state funding. The state faces a challenging budget process involving Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat-led House and a Republican-led Senate. The PRT’s vital statistics: One-third drop in ridership from 2019 levels $502.5 million in federal pandemic-driven aid exhausted $50 million deficit this year $100 million deficit next year if state funding is flat $360 million in reserves — enough to cover three years of deficits $40 million increase in state aid (13% over current levels) offered in Shapiro’s proposed budget $117 million increase in state funding — a 39% hike — sought to maintain current service. The potential changes, if state funding is flat: 8% to 9% fare increases, including base fare boost to $3, from $2.75 20% boost in ACCESS paratransit fares with service area cut in half 41 of roughly 100 bus routes, plus the T Silver Line, eliminated 50 or more bus routes, plus the T Red Line and the Mon Incline, reduced in service, length or both 19 municipalities and three Pittsburgh neighborhoods left with no service No extra service for special events 35% reduction in overall hours that bus, light rail and incline operate 20% loss of riders anticipated. The governor and General Assembly face a June 30 statutory deadline to finalize a budget for the 2026 fiscal year, though the state has missed that deadline in the past.
