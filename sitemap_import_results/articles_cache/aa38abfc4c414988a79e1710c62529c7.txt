Board members usually don’t get headlines. Those go to the mayor, the county executive, council members, controllers and directors. But boards often push for new policies, award contracts and grants, address demands for inclusion and equity, and more. The board structure is more diverse than it was 15 years ago, but gaps remain. It’s time for deeper exploration. PublicSource’s new Board Explorer sheds light on these panels and their roles, providing information about each member and inviting analysis of this important part of the region’s power structure. We have included 56 county, city and joint boards and commissions. As more panels form and membership changes, we'll periodically update. Explore with us, and, if you have a story idea or something you think we should investigate, please let us know . How diverse are the city and county boards and commissions?
